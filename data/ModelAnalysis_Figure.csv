The upper layer of soil and highly fractured rock shown in gray allows lateral subsurface flow (also referred to here as interflow) of water.

A large contributing upland area (4–12 times the size of the bofedal) supplies groundwater to the bofedal. The bofedal is composed of layers of peat, clay and saprolite/glaciofluvial sediments. In the fill-up period, rain recharges groundwater and drives flow to bofedales, filling layers of clay and high porosity peat. Runoff in streams is small. Once the bofedal saturates, catchment wide storage capacity is filled, and successive storms generate a steady-state response generating large streamflow. In the release phase, the absence of precipitation leads to decreased groundwater contributions to bofedales and they drain slowly through low conductivity basal layers, sustaining dry season baseflow.",https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2214581823000812-gr8.jpg,CC BY-NC-ND 4.0,,N,N,1,Wetness,Fill-up/saturation/release,3,Vegetation icons,Icons,Soil types described,Describes soil types,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,streamflow,Channel flow,recharges groundwater,Vertical drainage to groundwater,flow,Groundwater flow,drain slowly through low conductivity basal layers,Lateral matrix flow,baseflow,Gaining stream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Deep groundwater,Groundwater Storage,saturates,Soil saturation,catchment wide storage capacity,Total groundwater storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
