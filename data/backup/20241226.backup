375	\N	N/A	N/A	The primary loss component of the water balance is ET. The average annual ET rate for LRB has been quantified as 47% to 88% of annual rainfall (Bosch et al., 2004). Evapotranspiration was determined as the difference between annual rainfall and annual water loss. Annual water losses included annual streamflow and losses to regional groundwater. Losses to regional groundwater were assumed to be 1% of annual rainfall (Sheridan, 1997). In the LREW, streamflow is typically greater in the winter and early spring than during the summer and fall months (Sheridan, 1997; Shirmohammadi et al., 1986). Analyses of long-term hydrological trends have indicated that the winter and spring months typically have higher rainfall and lower ET (Bosch et al., 2017) which create greater soil moisture and aquifer recharge, increasing surface runoff responses and groundwater contributions to streamflow. In the LREW, direct surface runoff can vary between 5% and 40% of annual rainfall while shallow subsurface interflow can vary between 2% and 35% of annual rainfall (Asmussen & Ritchie, 1969; Bosch et al., 2012; Hubbard & Sheridan, 1983).\n\nBaseflow is particularly important in this region of rich surface and subsurface water resources that are essential for agriculture. In the LREW, baseflow was found to produce 53% of annual streamflow while stormflow was found to produce 47% (Bosch et al., 2017). In other Coastal Plain watersheds of similar size and having similar characteristics, baseflow ranging from 58% to 73% has been reported (Novak et al., 2003). Due to the highly variable transmissivity of the surficial aquifer, baseflow contributions to streamflow can be quite temporally variable. In the LREW, contributions of baseflow to streamflow have been found to vary seasonally as a function of varying ET levels and aquifer storage (Bosch et al., 2017). Baseflow was the greatest during the months from December through May (55%–57%) and the least during the months from June through November (43%–46%). Annual baseflow was found to decrease with increasing annual rainfall, indicating that during high rainfall years saturation excess driven stormflow increases in the LREW. Hydrograph analysis indicated an average stormflow duration of 7 days in the largest Little River Watershed (LRB, Figure 1), typically extended by interflow in this watershed (Bosch et al., 2017).\n\nWhile row-crops across the LREW play an important economic and environmental role, the LREW landscape is dominated by a dense dendritic network of stream channels bordered by riparian forest wetlands (Asmussen et al., 1979). Within LRB, 22% of the area is covered with upland forests while 28% is covered by riparian forests (Bosch et al., 2004, Bosch et al., 2006 LandSat data). These forested areas play a key role in the LREW hydrology and water quality. Evapotranspiration for the forested portion of the watershed is considered much larger than ET from the row-crops and pasture. Bosch et al. (2014) measured transpiration rates for a forested slash pine (P. elliottii Engelm.) riparian buffer and quantified the rates to be 1114 mm for the period from April to December, or 103% of potential ET.\n\n(4 Discussion) Surface water ponds throughout the watershed used to supply irrigation water are typically installed on first order streams. These ponds are frequently supplemented with groundwater from the deeper Floridan Aquifer. High volumes of irrigation would thus be expected to influence runoff by introducing inputs in addition to rainfall. While the fraction of irrigated land in LRN is greatest, this does not appear to have an impact on streamflow or Sratio in that watershed. Because most of the irrigation occurs during the summer period when ET is very high and landscape conditions are typically dry, the increased irrigation does not appear to impact streamflow at the levels of irrigated land observed here. [...] he water yield-drainage area relationship observed here is consistent with that of a drainage network that intercepts surface runoff and lateral subsurface flow from uplands and has low deep seepage losses [...] A slight decrease in water yield is observed as the watershed area increases (Figure 5) (trend not found significant, α = 0.05). Based upon the general trend obtained from the fitted line to the log–log plot, the water yield decreases from the smallest watershed studied here (LRM) to the largest studied (Alapaha) the water yield decreases from 390 to 274 mm. This decrease indicates increasing consumptive water use with increasing open water/wetland area in the region, attributed to increased ET that occurs with increasing relative open water and wetlands.	1.2	2	Hydrology and evapotranspiration	2	3	Vegetation types described	N	N	N	N	N	N	124	375	8	7	2

163	\N	N/A	N/A	In the upstream area, granite is the dominant formation explaining the lower ionic content in groundwater, in contrast to the downstream areas, where geologically diverse formations and land use increase the ionic content of groundwater. The weathered granite layer allows rain to infiltrate to the deeper groundwater reservoir through preferential flowpaths with less contact time for weathering processes to occur. This explains the hydrochemical signature of the deep groundwater component, which is characterized by its moderate electrical conductivities, moderate to high dissolved silica, lower ionic content, and low potassium concentrations. The chemical signature of the shallow groundwater component is characterized by the high electrical conductivities, alkalinity, sulfates, potassium, and nitrates that are washed from top geological layers with large ionic content and land uses such as agriculture and mining that are more predominant in the downstream region of the catchment. The three-component hydrograph separations suggest that the shallow groundwater component (potentially including surface runoff) is quickly activated during rainfall events, and its contribution increases as the antecedent precipitation increases as observed during Events 1 and 4, where the shallow groundwater contributions were 45 and 20–21 %, respectively. Moreover, a connection between surface and groundwater is evident from the groundwater contour map (Fig. 2d), which shows a gaining river system, and from the flow duration curves, which indicate exfiltrating groundwater storages to the streams. Further literature (Hughes, 2010) suggests that most of South Africa’s groundwater is stored in secondary aquifers and that surface flow may be nourished by lateral flow from semi-saturated fracture systems after storm events. Other studies (Petersen, 2012) in the nearby Kruger National Park (KNP) have shown that groundwater recharge occurs mostly during the wet season and groundwater flow travels in accordance with the topographical relief. Petersen (2012) studied a granite-dominated area and a basaltic-rock-dominated area, approximately 30 km east of the Kaap outlet. The study found that the granite region was mainly characterized by the steep topography, which favors overland flow that infiltrates through depressions, cracks and fractures by preferential pathways, while the southern basaltic section with a flatter topography showed piston flow processes to be more predominant. The Petersen (2012) findings, covering studies of approximately 1011 boreholes in the KNP, support the findings in the Kaap catchment where high fracturing in the granite section allows recharge of deeper groundwater reservoirs through preferential flowpaths.	5.1	4194	Runoff processes in the Kaap catchment	1	4	N	Soil types described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	Uncertainty described	N	110	163	1	5	2

155	\N	N/A	N/A	A principal finding was that during the wet season, saturation overland flow (as well as subsurface stormflow principally in the top 0.2 m depth) occurred spatially much more extensively during large monsoon events (Bonell et al., 1981) than had previously been supported in the literature from humid temperate latitudes (see reviews of Dunne (1983) and Buttle (1994)). The complementary environmental tracer work (which used both deuterium and non-isotopes) confirmed one of the hypothesis (originating from the hydrometric campaign) that the storm hydrograph consists of a much larger proportion of 'new' water (60-70% for South Creek undisturbed and 70-80% for North Creek - disturbed, Bonell et al, 1997; 50-70% South Creek, Elsenbeer et al, 1995b) than established in most humid temperate studies. In fact, around the hydrograph peak, event water proportions can exceed 90% especially from the topographically steeper, South Creek (Bonell et al, 1997). In a separate study using EMMA, Elsenbeer et al (1995a, p. 2273) remarked for one event that '...the contribution of saturation overland flow reaches almost 80%o near peak flow at which time the groundwater contribution nearly vanishes.' Nonetheless, up to five contributing 'reservoirs' to the storm hydrograph, were identified which could only be established by access to a more sophisticated hydrometric data base to complement the intermittent water sampling on the hillslopes (for previously stated technical reasons) (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). The upper two stores as expected, were saturation overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow. The continuous records from piezometers and soil-water pressure transducers however, indicated exfiltration (return flow, Chorley, 1978, p. 371) occurrence at selected points so that this flow vector would modify the more-biased event signature of saturation overland flow, and thus complicate attempts at chemical storm hydrograph separation. (Bonell et al., 1997). Such modification of the surface flow vector was inferred from chemical analysis of water samples taken from shallow rills during storms and using EMMA (Elsenbeer et al, 1994, 1995a). The third possible reservoir was the detected convergence of upward/downward fluxes of soil water during transient, saturation at more substantial depths in the deep vadose zone. Even more surprising was the detection of macropore flow penetration to up to 7 m depth during large storms whose isotopic signature was not completely mixed with the surrounding matrix water (based on sampling pipeflow (Elsenbeer & Bonell, unpublished data)). Consequently the upper layer of the deep permanent groundwater is the recipient of this macropore flow, and acts as a mixing zone, thus giving a fourth reservoir on the lines described by Andersen & Burt (1982). Finally beneath is the fifth reservoir, which is a large, deep body of well-mixed groundwater whose capacity from modelling (Barnes & Bonell, 1996) was estimated to be in the order of 3000 mm. When concerning modelling despite this complexity (in terms of spatial and temporal contributions from up to four subsurface reservoirs) such diverse origins would seem in the first instance to be minimized by 'collapsing' all these sources into one 'subsurface' compartment. The return flow component formed part of the surface compartment, along with saturation overland flow (Barnes & Bonell, 1996). Despite the long previous hydrometric campaign, several new features were detected which led to a better understanding of storm runoff generation. By following a dual hydrometric-hydrochemistry approach, there was recognition of the greater importance of the deep, permanent groundwater table in terms of its contributions of 'old' water to the storm hydrograph soon after peak discharge occurred. Thus this feature was much more connected to the surface hydrology than it was previously thought (Bonell et a/., 1981). In addition, the detection of deep, vertical macropore flow, whose characteristics more favored the description of Mosley (1979, 1982), cf. Pearce et al. (1986), could be attributed to the prevailing high rain intensities (Bonell et al., 1997). Moreover, there was no evidence for the existence of groundwater ridging. A sampled water table profile adjacent to organized drainage showed the characteristics of a more traditional, free water surface profile. During the course of storms, the gradient steepened in response to macropore flow and subsequently relaxed towards, or at the termination of an event, which thus provided the capability of contributing significant groundwater contributions to organized surface drainage (especially from the upper, fourth reservoir). As, previously indicated, the work also supported the notion of a very high, effective hydraulic conductivity (Bazemore et al, 1994; Bonell & Barnes, 1997) for the catchment, which also utilized an input, from the Barnes & Bonell (1996) model, to calculate the peak from the 'slow' flow hydrograph. The fact that the effective hydraulic conductivity is in the same order of magnitude as separate measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity for the top 0.1 m of soil suggests that the transmissivity feedback concept of Bishop (1991), through subsurface stormflow and return flow, could be the primary explanation supplemented by described macropore flow in the deeper subsoil, including from pipes (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). There was no need to search for a particular type of groundwater mechanism, i.e., ridging (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). In addition, the hydrometric hydrochemistry approach supported the Bonell-Cassells mechanism (Cassells et al, 1985; named and reviewed in Crapper & Barnes, 1993), whereby the intense tropical rainfall rapidly exceeds the superficial unsaturated zone storage capacity of the soil profile, and is independent of any downslope subsurface stormflow. This mechanism is capable of inducing near-instantaneous areas of saturation over a large area of the catchment. Nevertheless the recognition of more significant vertical, preferential flow via macropores has caused a modification of the conceptual model previously put forward in Bonell (1993, fig. 1). The shallow 'impeding' layer (>0,2m depth) is penetrated by spatially-variable, preferential flow.

341	\N	N/A	N/A	This study has examined the role of intensity and wetness thresholds in determining runoff responses for an agricultural catchment in the Lang Lang River catchment, Victoria, Australia. Both intensity dependent and wetness dependent thresholds were identified in the runoff response. During wet conditions, hydrological connectivity has a strong influence on water delivery to the riparian area. Saturation excess runoff from the riparian zone was also important. The results of this study demonstrated the following. 1. Runoff generation in most events is dependent on the catchment connectivity and soil moisture conditions. When the sum of the antecedent soil water storage and event rainfall exceeded 250 mm, runoff was typically produced by a mix of saturation excess and subsurface storm flow. Under these conditions, a water table forms in the soil and a saturated area develops in the riparian zone. When the water level rises to within about 1 m of the surface at mid-slope sites, rapid subsurface flow pathways are activated which connected the mid-slope and riparian area, contributing event flow to the flume at the catchment outlet. 2. When the catchment became very wet, high water levels persisted at the mid-slope sites, which remained hydrologically connected to the riparian area, and baseflow became persistent between events. 3. High rainfall intensity events produced runoff even when the antecedent soil water storage (ASI) plus event rainfall depth was below the 250 mm threshold. This could be due to either Hortonian overland flow or fast subsurface preferential flow paths being activated	5	4542	Conclusion	1	2	N	N	N	N	N	Multiple interpretations demonstrated	N	181	341	1	5	2

301	\N	N/A	N/A	Sixteen rainfall-runoff events that were recorded in a small agricultural catchment were evaluated in order to identify the major runoff mechanisms and their implication for soil erosion and sediment transport from the catchment. Most of the events that were initiated by precipitation of various intensities and durations resulted in a rapid increase of stream discharge with no surface runoff in the catchment (as documented by field survey).The shallow subsurface runoff taking place within the topsoil layer is the most common mechanism. Monitoring of the topsoil physical properties shows seasonal variability, but we have not identified a clear relationship between actual soil conditions and dominant runoff formation mechanism in the studied catchment. The surface runoff, mostly  saturated excess driven, occurs only seldom and was caused by heavy rainfall in combination with high antecedent catchment saturation. The topsoil was never compacted to such a level that infiltration excess overland flow could dominate. In the period of four years for which the catchment has been monitored, two extreme events have been observed, in which surface runoff caused by topsoil saturation excess overland flow was clearly dominant.

302	\N	N/A	N/A	Ground water in the Neversink watershed typically discharges as seeps or springs at the base of steep slopes and from rock outcrops, or discharges directly into the stream channel. Discharge of water from deep ground-water sources occurs throughout the year, and is the principal source of stream flow during the dry summer months. This water has typically moved through bedrock fractures and bedding planes (fig. 2), and generally remains below the surface for several months to more than one year. Some water moves through the matrix of the bedrock, but much slower than through the fractures and bedding planes. The discharge rate of these springs tends to vary from season to season, but does not respond to individual storms (fig. 3A; Burns and others, 1998). During extended periods of rainfall or snowmelt, rates of recharge can exceed rates of discharge, which results in upward movement of the water table (the level below which all pore spaces and fractures are filled with water). In March or April the water table is likely to be in the soil profile, within centimeters of the surface, whereas in late summer, the water table is likely to be below the soil profile, and possibly below the till (fig. 3B, Burns and others, 1998). As the water table rises, subsurface water is able to discharge from the till and the soil, as well as from bedrock (fig. 2). When the water table rises into the soil, high stream flow is maintained between storms, and rapid increases in stream flow occur during rainstorms and snowmelt, as ephemeral streams form in channels that are dry throughout most of the year. Stream water under these conditions is a mixture of ground water and soil water that reflects a range of subsurface-residence times. During drier times of the year, heavy rainstorms can also rapidly increase stream flows for short periods of time, through lateral transport of water through the soil and upper ground water reservoirs, even though the water table is deep in the till or bedrock (Brown and others, 1999). Once the rain stops, however, streamflow quickly recedes to low, pre-storm levels. 	N/A	4	Discharge of Ground Water and\nSoil Water to Streams	1	1	N	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	157	302	1	2	2

306	\N	N/A	N/A	Strikingly, average antecedent soil moisture at the forested site explained almost 92% of the observed runoff coefficients and was clearly better than all combinations of pre-event discharge, precipitation sum, maximum intensity, average antecedent at the grassland site we played through. Pre-event discharge alone explained also 60% of the observed runoff coefficients and was strongly correlated to average soil moisture at the grassland site. We thus conclude that subsurface storm flow or fast groundwater flow is the domination the runoff generating process, at least in the snow-free period. We think that saturation excess overland flow plays due to the high porosity of the top soil, which is more than 0.60 m3 m−3, and the large amount of gravel a minor role. 	5.2	886	Soil moisture control on event runoff	1	1	Vegetation described	Soil hydraulic properties described	N	N	N	N	N	257	306	1	2	2

359	\N	N/A	N/A	Bofedales contribute to catchment wide water storage and sustain baseflow through three mechanisms (Fig. 8). First, bofedales form in low gradient, glacially carved landscapes. Upland bofedales form in cirques, in which lakes or ponds become peat-forming through a process of terrestrialization. Bofedales are thus located in interior basins that, in the URW, are 4 − 12 times greater than the bofedal itself. Thus, bofedales intercept large volumes of groundwater, which leads to seasonal saturation. Second, layers of high porosity peat (with high drainable porosity) form a natural sponge to seasonally store tremendous volumes of water. Third, the combined effects of a low water table gradient and low hydraulic conductivities in underlying clay and mineral layers, result in the slow release of water from bofedales to streams. Although our study is the first to quantify the hydrology of bofedales in the context of water resources in the humid puna, previous studies have shown water flowing through wetlands to have longer mean transit times (e.g., Lyon et al., 2010; Roa-García and Weiler, 2010; Buytaert et al., 2011; Lane et al., 2020; Lazo et al., 2019) and argued the presence of wetlands increases or dominates the existing catchment wide water storage (e.g., Lane et al., 2020). The impact of bofedal groundwater dynamics on streamflow is best illustrated through the three phases: ‘fill-up,’ ‘steady-state,’ and ‘release.’ In the fill-up phase, precipitation recharges the unsaturated zone to field capacity as the water table in bofedales continues to fall to nearly 2 m below the ground surface. After an average of 138 mm of precipitation, field capacity is reached in the upland rooting zone, causing drainage, and groundwater inflow to the bofedales. Bofedales saturate at the beginning of the steady-state phase. At this point, seasonally dynamic water storage in the URW has approached the storage capacity, and runoff rapidly increases as the catchment sheds additional precipitation. We note the likelihood of saturation overland flow across bofedales during the steady-state phase. The end of the rainy season in May – June marks the start of the release phase. Groundwater from hillslopes continues to move through bofedales to streams at rates sufficient to maintain saturation in the bofedales until an average of 41 days into the dry season, at which point the water table begins to fall at an average rate of 14 mm/day. Additional moisture depletion in the peat and clay below field capacity occurs due to transpiration of deeply rooted hydrophytic plants.	4.5	15	Conceptual model of bofedal hydrology	2	4	N	Multiple properties described	N	Topography described	N	N	N	243	359	2	5	2
371	\N	N/A	N/A	The HOAL is special in that many runoff generation mechanisms can be observed simultaneously in different parts of the catchment (Fig. 5). Due to shallow, low permeable soils and the use of the catchment area as agricultural land, the concave part of the catchment was tile drained in the 1940s in an effort to reduce water logging. The estimated drainage area from the tile drains is about 15 % of the total catchment and can be divided into two bigger systems in the south-western part of the catchment and four smaller drainage systems in the north-eastern part. The pipes drain into the main stream at four locations. Two tile drain systems (Sys1, Sys2) do not dry out during the year, while two are ephemeral (Frau1, Frau2) (see Fig. 7). The uppermost 25 % of the stream was piped in the 1940s to enlarge the agricultural production area. The pipe enters the main stream at inlet Sys4. Its flow dynamics and chemistry are similar to those of the permanent tile drains as it drains the surrounding soil. There are two clearly visible springs that directly discharge into the stream. These are Q1 and K1. The water from Q1 originates from a fractured siltstone aquifer with distinct hydrologic and chemical characteristic from those of other point sources along the stream. The hydrologic dynamics and chemical characteristics of K1 are more similar to the perennial tile drainages. Q1 is perennial, while K1 is not. In the south-eastern part of the catchment is a small wetland close to the stream which permanently seeps into the stream via two rivulets (A1, A2). The wetland is fed by springs at the upper part of the wetland and usually responds very quickly to all types of rainfall due to its high saturation state. During low-intensity events in summer, the flow in the main stream responds to rainfall with substantial delay as the soil usually offers a lot of storage capacity, depending on soil moisture. A mixture of tile drainage water, diffusive inflow from the shallow aquifer, spring water, and surface water from the wetland tends to feed the stream. During major storms, saturation overland flow occurs across the fields (mainly in the depression areas along the thalweg and close to the stream) which enters the stream at two (E1, E2) or three locations, depending on the magnitude of the event. The overland flow causes gully erosion. During high-intensity thunderstorms in summer and spring, infiltration excess overland flow tends to occur with a very substantial, fast contribution from the tile drainage system. During infiltration excess overland flow events, all forms of erosion from interrill to gully erosion may occur on the fields that are poorly covered by crops (such as bare soil after soil management), but sedimentation immediately occurs when the sediment laden water enters a field with better cover (such as wheat). During very dry periods in summer, the high clay contents will cause shrinking cracks which act as macropores for re-infiltration during subsequent events. In winter, rain-on-snow runoff may occur as saturation overland flow during large events leading to gully erosion. In fact, this is when most of the overland flow occurs during the year. However, the main runoff generation mechanism in winter is through lateral subsurface pathways (shallow sub- surface preferential flow paths, drainage pipes). Even minor events (of, say, 5 mm) will lead to a significant increase in streamflow due to high soil moisture during the winter. After freezing periods, when the soil is still frozen, infiltration excess overland flow may occur.	3.1.2	232	Catchment description	1	4	Vegetation types described	N	N	N	N	N	N	94	371	1	11	2

213	\N	N/A	N/A	The three watersheds showed very low annual runoff ratios during the 3-year record, combined with long spells of zero flow. [...] Like Amatya et al. (1996) and Slattery et al. (2006), we found that soil properties, especially buried argillic horizons with low permeability (i.e., the throttle for lateral flow), strongly influenced runoff generation in these low-relief coastal plain regions [...] Our site, like that reported by Devito et al. (2005a), showed that dry catchment conditions frequently led to dis-connectivity of the uplands with the valley bottom and stream. This resulted in low runoff coefficients and the dominance of evaporation in the water balance. In addition, direct precipitation on the stream channel can alter the isotope signal, when flow is close to zero. This was observed during March 2011, when very heavy precipitation (δ18O = 3.9 ‰) led to a deviation between stream isotope signals and riparian isotopic signals adjacent to the streams throughout the area. Figure 8 conceptually summarizes the runoff generation and isotopic signature at the study site. A key element is the rare or nonexistent connectivity in the hillslope–riparian–stream continuum and the enrichment in heavy water isotopes in the riparian zone/wetlands that supplies baseflow. Further, the deeper groundwater system can interact with the groundwater of the riparian zone during wet conditions and is likely a major contributor to the riparian groundwater. [...] The strong evaporative enrichment of groundwater suggests groundwater recharge influenced by enriched soil water.  Streams and riparian groundwater were even more enriched in heavy isotopes, suggesting further isotopic enrichment of the riparian groundwater as it reemerged in the low-relief and slow-moving stream floodplain. Our measured isotopic enrichment and the low annual runoff coefficients suggest that evapotranspiration strongly influences the runoff dynamics in the R, B, and C watersheds, consistent with the behavior of other lower-relief watersheds in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA (La Torre Torres et al., 2011) and elsewhere (Devito et al., 2005a).	4	131	Discussion	6	1	N	Horizons described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	1	213	2	2	2

223	\N	N/A	N/A	Rainfall events in summer with sums of more than 20 mm and dry soil moisture states can experience up to 20 mm of initial loss or more before runoff is generated (Figs 5(a), 6(b)), even high intensity rainstorms are dominated only by runoff from sealed surfaces, including roads and lanes and pasture patches near the creek. The tile drains do not necessarily contribute in such summer events, but this is highly dependent on the antecedent soil moisture conditions and crack development. The “transition” months April and May are still influenced by winter soil moisture conditions. In October runoff generation is dependent on the gradual soil moisture rise through declining evapotranspiration rates and so features the highest variability in runoff coefficients (Fig. 4(a)). The winter months are characterized through constantly high soil moisture states, continuous tile drain discharge and a quick response of the saturated fields to surface runoff. Concluding the behaviour of the Tannhausen catchment, individual events show a classifiable behaviour but they are strongly dependent on soil moisture and antecedent climatic conditions so that predictions seem to be difficult without knowledge about actual soil moisture conditions. A spatial observation of soil moisture could be helpful for prediction of antecedent conditions (Zehe et al., 2005). On the other hand, seasonal prediction seems to be rather easy in clay soil catchments. The process study in the Tannhausen microscale catchment shows the strong domination of soil moisture for runoff generation. In winter the soil reacts like a sealed surface, contributing to most of the runoff volume. The precipitation pattern of an event dominates runoff generation. In summer the soil with its cracks reacts like a sponge, reducing surface runoff generation to sealed surfaces.

(a) Pre-recharge conditions: water moves slowly through the unsaturated zone, ground-water moves through the bedrock adjacent to and underlying the floodplain aquifer (alluvium), and chemically homogeneous ground water fills the saturated portion of the alluvium. (b) Recharge conditions: precipitation enters the bedrock aquifer(s) rapidly, probably through fractures. The newly recharged water displaces ‘resident’ ground water in the bedrock into the alluvium, causing a relatively rapid rise in water table because of injection of more sulfate-rich water (vertical bars) from the bedrock into the base of the alluvium. The rise in water table entrains high-nitrate water (slanted bars) in the inundated part of the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone water flow continues downward, but is still slow, because low hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium prevents rapid recharge. Unsaturated zone air is pushed upward out of the ground, also, as the alluvium water table rises. (c) Early post-recharge: when recharge to the bedrock ceases, the water table begins to fall as the water in the alluvium drains to the creek. The drop in the water table draws ‘fresh’ atmosphere into the unsaturated zone. The water in the alluvial aquifer begins to mix. (d) Later post-recharge: as the water table continues to fall, mixing continues, and the water also now comes into equilibrium with the fresh unsaturated zone air, resulting in a pulse of oxygen in the alluvial aquifer. The oxygen levels in the alluvial-aquifer ground water decline because of microbial processes, and mixing of the alluvium ground water continues until a nearly chemically homogeneous floodplain aquifer is reestablished (a).	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	1	4	Vegetation described	Soil types described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	N	N	115	103	1	6	1

In the exploded view at top, thickness of subsurface layers has been exaggerated two-fold. The subsurface saturated variable source area near the weir, shown here at its maximum extent, expands and contracts in response to rainfall, and controls the contribution of relatively short travelled, young water from the vadose zone to runoff. In the main figure, shading depicts areas believed to be saturated during the steady conditions of the sprinkling experiments. Saturated zone thickness in the colluvium has been exaggerated to make it visible. Extent of saturation in colluvium is constrained by over 200 piezometers; saturation in fresh rock is constrained by the 35 m well at the ridge crest. Solid arrows show inferred flow paths, predominantly infiltrating into the weathered rock layers high on the slope, but with considerable rapid flow back and forth between colluvium and weathered rock in the lower portion of the slope.

196	\N	N/A	N/A	Spatial flow variability. Studies of runoff generation in interior Alaska (Dingman 1971, 1973, Kane et al. 1981 ) suggest that the extent of permafrost exerts a strong control on the open-water-season hydrologic response of small watersheds. Kane et al. (1981) studied the differences in runoff processes between permafrost-underlain and permafrost-free soils in Glenn Creek and found that permafrost underlain soils contributed the major portion of spring runoff. During winter the organic layer over these soils provides a moisture supply for vertical transport upward to the snowpack, increasing its water equivalent. The organic mat becomes dessicated over the winter, so during snowmelt, water from the snowpack may be used to satisfy its moisture deficit instead of becoming runoff (Santeford 1978, Slaughter and Kane 1978, Kane et al. 1981). In permafrost areas the poorly drained mineral soils under this mat often cause ice-rich conditions to develop in the vicinity of streams and valley bottoms. The ice restricts drainage, so that once the organic mat moisture deficit is satisfied, water in these areas moves downslope through the mat to the stream. On the other hand, soils in permafrost-free areas are moderately well drained (even when frozen), so water can infiltrate them once the organic mat moisture deficit has been satisfied. No overland flow will occur until the infiltration capacity of these soils is exceeded. Kane et al. (1981) observed no overland flow on permafrost-free, south-facing slopes, indicating that this rarely occurs (Dingman 1971). As a result, permafrost-free soils contribute little to runoff during snowpack ablation. [...] Thus, most of the differences in response between C-2 and C-3 appear to be attributable to the percentage of permafrost in the two watersheds. The plots of the data for Glenn Creek, with 68.5% permafrost, are essentially parallel to those for C-3, in spite of the considerably lower relief ratio and drainage density of Glenn Creek. Response differences between C-2 and C-3 indicate that the variable-source-area process may be operating as suggested by Dingman(1971) for Glenn Creek. If so, the restricted drainage due to permafrost results in more wide-spread saturated and nearly saturated zones and thus more overland flow in C-3, as reflected in Figure 14. To the extent that Hortonian overland flow occurs, the more widespread poorly drained soils in C-3 may also result in more overland flow to the channel. The widespread permafrost on slopes and beneath the channel in C-3 may result in much smaller groundwater contributions and lower base flows than in C-2, as shown in Figure 14. [...] This analysis suggests that the hydrologic response of small watersheds in central Alaska is strongly controlled by permafrost. When permafrost underlies a significant portion of a watershed and is present beneath most stream channels, the streanflow peaks in response to rainstorms will be relatively high, and the base flows between storms will be relatively low. Watersheds with little permafrost will have lower peaks and higher sustained base flows per unit area.

373	\N	N/A	N/A	The deep soil keeps the groundwater away from the surface, causing runoff to cease quickly after events. It may sound counterintuitive that water flow will cease in deep soils with higher storage capacity, however, at this scale we are mainly seeing water stored in the soil which is not necessarily coming from deep groundwater storage. Therefore, besides soil depth, flow permanence might be controlled by the interaction of topographic characteristics (e.g., slope and contribution area) and soil properties. Where the soil is shallow and steep, between W5 and W7, the water table emerges on the surface, fed by the deep and gentle soils upstream, maintaining the flow beyond the time scale of the event. The channel morphology must also be considered in the runoff generation. The intermittent channel has a well-defined channel bed and is mainly composed of sand. In the lower part of the slope, near the wells W11 and W10, the soil is also shallow and steep, but it is formed by boulders, which could increase the transmissivity of the soil and consequently increase the losses through infiltration.\nThe total precipitation threshold for the beginning of runoff is very low and almost any event can start the runoff in the slopes. The density of active drainage increases with total precipitation, but the places of origin of the flow can be highly variable. The fragmentation of the flowing network leads to a high density of active drainage, but a low density of connected drainage. The antecedent moisture control over the beginning of the hillslope-outlet connection is clear for events larger than 10 mm. If the antecedent moisture of the basin is high and it does not rain with enough maximum intensity to overcome the transmissivity of the soil, the connection will not be reached. When connectivity is established, it increases with increasing total precipitation. There is a limited flow capacity and the moisture threshold must be exceeded long enough for the process to have a significant impact, connecting the slope to the channels as it has been noticed in other studies [18,19]. During high-intensity events there may be an increase in runoff even though the soil moisture threshold has not been exceeded. For Class 4 events (>85 mm), total precipitation and intensity control drainage density and connectivity. The study basin shows a mixture of processes dependent on intensity and on moisture for establishing the connection of the slope by surface paths, something that has rarely been reported for humid catchments [18].\nVariations in flow distribution and flow travel time are largely controlled by the topography and infiltration capacity of the soil [27]. The high rate of soil infiltration and the low saturated hydraulic conductivity (Table 1) can provide soil saturation close to the surface, suggesting the occurrence of saturation-excess overland flow [3]. The direct relationship between the frequency of OFDs’ activation and the slope area [27] and the inverse relationship between frequency of OFDs’ activation and the concavity of the contribution areas [44] is an indication of fast flow, facilitated by the topographic characteristics despite the relationship being weak. The most active OFD was located where the contribution area changed the most. The difference in the frequency of activation of the sensors can be explained by the anisotropy of soil properties [45] and vegetation characteristics [43]. Soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity can be changed in areas with different vegetation stages [46], making some regions more conducive to flow generation [16].\nThe influence of vegetation has not been quantified; however, the high infiltration rates are the first indication that the structure of the forest has a significant role in the generation of runoff, mainly in processes that occur close to the surface.	4	11	Discussion	2	2	N	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	184	373	1	3	2
343	\N	N/A	N/A	Overall, the Pallas catchment streamflow shows fast responses (<1 h) to precipitation events (Figure 3), indicating rather limited dynamic storage in the catchment. Stream hydrographs are flashy, indicating rapid responses to rainfall events, limited soil storage, and active surface runoff generation from landscape units. […] Compared to local annual precipitation amounts of 647 mm, mean short-term aquifer volume (STS) values as low as 14 mm support limited catchment storage in Pallas. […] Based on these analyses, 69 ± 9% of streamflow during the snowy season originates from rainfall and 31 ± 9% from snowfall. During the rainy season, 70 ± 9% of streamflow comes from rainfall and 30 ± 9% from snowfall, which is similar to the snowy season. […] Annual ET derives almost equally from snowy season precipitation (48 ± 7%) and rainy season precipitation (52 ± 7%). Similar trends are also evident in the dual-isotope plot (Figure 2). For example, the stream data for spring and early summer 2014 show relatively low δ18O values during peak flow from snowmelt, followed by a rapid increase from −15.5‰ to −12‰ coincident with a large rainfall event (Figure 3(c)), and indicative of limited STS catchment storage capacity and an extensive network of rapid surface flow paths. Indeed, the Pallas hillslope is dominated by till with declining hydraulic conductivity to a depth of 30 cm, thus promoting overland strong flow formation as seen in stream discharge and isotopic data. Additionally, shallow soil structures maintain only limited soil and groundwater storage. […] \nSubsurface soil was fully saturated during the snowmelt runoff period, but moisture content declined markedly afterward (data not shown), indicating that the majority of snowmelt inputs produce runoff or generate groundwater recharge. In contrast, only large summer precipitation events (>20 mm) increased soil moisture content, indicating that summer precipitation either evapotranspired or produced direct runoff through preferential flow. Following larger rainfall events, catchment soils drain quickly (within days), indicating that soils in the upper hills do not store moisture between precipitation events. Soil moisture measurements indicate that the upper layer (top 5 cm) responds more quickly than lower layers (30 cm) to snowmelt or rainfall inputs, demonstrating flow through the till layers' (cf. Bishop et al., 2011), and enabling quick flow along with the upper more permeable soil layer in the forest areas. These observations are further supported by the minimal lag (within minutes) between rainfall events and water level rise in peatland piezometers, as well as the simultaneous increase in stream discharge due to rapid rainfall runoff from the hills and peatlands directly into the stream. Hence, these data further support that Pallas catchment storage is limited by the relatively shallow, young soil deposit layers. \n[…] Interestingly, although snowmelt contributes more than one-third of the catchment water input, meltwater isotope values only shift temporarily during the main spring flood peak towards snow isotope values. These data suggest that there is minimal dynamic snowmelt water storage in the catchment, due to highly permeable flow paths through the top peat layer (especially at the fen site), facilitating ephemeral snowmelt water presence in the stream. Short storage during snowmelt is further supported by the observation that the stream water isotope values exhibit only a short period of depletion (i.e., snow-like) and then within weeks become enriched and much more similar to those of GW. Relatively modest, short-lived responses of stream isotope values to snowmelt have been observed previously in other snow-influenced catchments with peat soils (Ala-aho et al., 2018; Tetzlaff et al., 2018). However, the overall isotope values in the stream, groundwater, and springs are depleted relative to precipitation, and gravitate towards depleted snowmelt isotope values (Figure 2), suggesting a dominant role of snowmelt in recharging groundwater reservoirs, as seen globally (Jasechko et al., 2014).\n	3.2	9	Limited catchment dynamic storage controls hydrological responses	1	3	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	167	343	1	1	2

332	\N	N/A	N/A	Converting cultivated fields to permanent, undisturbed grasslands reduced the wind-driven snow transport and snowmelt runoff, leading to drying out of the wetlands in the converted grass areas. Two factors operating together led to this hydrological effect: (1) tall permanent grass cover is effective in trapping snow, so that the wind-driven transport of snow into wetlands is reduced in grassed catchments; (2) the undisturbed grasscover leads to the development of a macropore network in the topsoil, which increases soil infiltrability, especially during the snowmelt period when the soil is frozen. The macropore network takes several years to develop after introduction of the grass, as indicated by the delayed hydrological response of the wetlands to the cultivated-to-grass conversion. Increased dryness of the soil beneath the grass is also a contributing factor, but its contribution is relatively minor. The net effect of the permanent cover of undisturbed tall grass is to trap snow effectively and infiltrate snowmelt water and summertime rain into the soil, where most of itis used to supply transpiration by the deep-rooted grass.

334	\N	N/A	N/A	Discharge measured at the main gauging station varies between below 5 m3 s−1 (winter) and 20 m3 s−1 (monsoon, Figure 2). A steep increase in discharge occurs in May, when snow melt at high altitudes coincides with the first monsoon rains in lower regions, soil thaws and becomes saturated (Figure 2). Variability in soil moisture after saturation is driven by precipitation events that result in high altitude snow fall and almost immediate melt shortly thereafter. By early June, the soil is near-saturated due to the snow melt, monsoon precipitation begins, and high elevation snow and ice melt is occurring. As a result the discharge rises rapidly, and has marked diurnal peaks. From then onwards, precipitation events measured at 5000 m a.s.l. are clearly and immediately visible in both soil moisture and discharge in the valley (Figure 2).\n\nThe streamflow decreases steeply in September as the monsoon withdraws. A distinct diurnal cycle is observed throughout the year, with low/high flows in the late morning/early afternoon in January and early afternoon/midnight in May, respectively.\n\nThe availability of multiple measured variables at different elevations, provides the opportunity to evaluate multiple processes at the catchment scale and validate models, especially related to the cryosphere and complex precipitation patterns typical for high mountain regions.\n\nPrevious research in the catchment shows a strong elevational gradient of precipitation, which peaks above 1500 mm annually around 3000 m a.s.l. (Collier & Immerzeel, 2015) and rapidly decreases up- and down-valley, with station data showing a drop from 1819 mm at 2370 m a.s.l. to just 867 mm at 3857 m a.s.l. (Immerzeel et al., 2014). At higher elevations the valley floors are generally drier than the southern and northern slopes that receive more orographic precipitation (Collier & Immerzeel, 2015). Temperatures decrease from average 15°C around 1500 m a.s.l. to 0°C at 5000 m a.s.l. Heterogeneous precipitation and temperature patterns drive variability in snow cover (Girona-Mata et al., 2019) and snow depth (Stigter et al., 2017). Areal snow melt is highly complex due to the extreme relief in the valley, patchy snow cover, and delayed melt output caused by refreezing of melt water within the snow pack (Saloranta et al., 2019). Melt contributions from glacier ice are additionally impacted by a thick layer of debris on the main glacier tongues, which inhibits melt and delays the melt peak.	4	4	Research insights	1	3	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	122	334	1	1	2

276	\N	N/A	N/A	[9] Fresh bedrock is exposed at the lower end of the watershed (Figure 1). Water continuously flows from the soil layer just above the weir (Figures 1 and 2), and this point is referred to as the “spring.” The surface outlets of some natural soil pipes were seen along the longitudinal axis of the hollow (Figures 1 and 2). [...] [10] Previous hydrological studies of Toinotani zero-order valley have demonstrated the importance of pipe flow in runoff generation [Mizuyama, 1994; Uchida et al., 1999]. Mizuyama [1994] observed that during a heavy rain (total rainfall was 70 mm; peak rainfall intensity was 18 mm h−1), water flowed from the spring, pipe A, and pipe group B (Figure 2). Hortonian overland flow did not occur in Toinotani as a result of the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil. Even in this heavy storm event, the groundwater table did not intersect the soil surface, and saturation overland flow was seldom observed [Mizuyama, 1994]. However, pipe flow discharge resulted in surface flow in between the outlet of pipe A and the spring (Figure 2). A recent study called the overland flow from soil pipes “pipe overland flow” [Putty and Prasad, 2000]. At Toinotani both subsurface storm flow and pipe overland flow have been shown to be dominant sources of storm runoff generation (Figure 2).\n[11] Measurements of 102 storms showed that the storm runoff could be classified into three stages. In the first stage, water discharge occurs only from the spring. As the rainfall intensity and the cumulative rainfall increase, water comes out of pipe A (Figure 2). Under the heaviest rainfall, additional discharge occurs from pipe group B (the third stage). A combination of the antecedent precipitation index and the peak rainfall intensity is useful to predict the presence of ephemeral flow from pipe A and pipe group B [Uchida et al., 1999]. [...] Lateral water movement could be classified into two categories based on the rainfall magnitude. When the total rainfall was less than ∼30 mm, the runoff process could be explained by Darcy's law using the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from soil cores. When the total rainfall amount was greater than ∼30 mm, streamflow immediately increased after the occurrence of pipe flow, even though the pore water pressure at the near-spring well was stable. Moreover, when pipe flow occurred, the estimated effective hydraulic conductivity was 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity. Results of both the thermal response and recession hydrograph indicated that when pipe flow was >0.008 mm h−1 (0.013 L s−1), the source of streamflow was the same as pipe flow. In other words, the transient groundwater was delivered from the area upslope of the soil pipe outlet to the stream via soil pipes, shortcutting the normal mixing with the groundwater near the spring.\n[45] When the antecedent condition was relatively dry (API10 was <7 mm), the transient groundwater was dominated by preevent soil water. In contrast, after a storm with >70 mm of rainfall and wet antecedent condition, water emerging from the bedrock contributed to the formation of transient saturated groundwater. Furthermore, despite the dry antecedent condition, after a heavy rainfall with >190 mm the bedrock groundwater was an important contributor to the transient groundwater in the upslope area. When water emerging from the bedrock contributed to the formation of the transient groundwater, the bedrock groundwater was delivered to the stream via soil pipes, shortcutting the normal mixing process through the soil matrix. Consequently, after a heavy downpour the contribution of bedrock groundwater to the falling limb of both streamflow and pipe flow were considerable.	2, 6	2	Study Site, Summary and Conclusions	1	3	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	232	276	1	6	2

183	\N	N/A	N/A	The 3.2 km2 Bruntland Burn catchment (Fig. 6), located in north-eastern Scotland, was used as a benchmark study to test the model's performance based on a rich data base of hydrological measurements. The Bruntland Burn is a typical upland catchment in northwestern Europe (e.g., Birkel et al., 2010), namely a combination of steep and rolling hillslopes and over-widened valley bottoms due to the glacial legacy of this region. The valley bottom areas are covered by deep (in parts >30 m) glacial drift deposits (e.g., till) containing a large amount of stored water superimposed on a relatively impermeable granitic solid geology (Soulsby et al., 2016). Peat soils developed (>1 m deep) in these valley bottom areas, which remain saturated throughout most of the year with a dominant near-surface runoff generation mechanism delivering runoff quickly via micro-topographical flow pathways connected to the stream network (Soulsby et al., 2015). Brown rankers, peaty rankers and peat soils are responsible for a flashy hydrological regime driven by saturation excess overland flow, while humus iron podzols on the hillslopes do not favor near-surface saturation but rather facilitate groundwater recharge through vertical water movement (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). Land use is dominated by heather moorland, with smaller areas of rough grazing and forestry on the lower hillslopes. Its annual precipitation is 1059 mm, with the summer months (May–August) generally being the driest (Ali et al., 2014). Snow makes up less than 10 % of annual precipitation and melts rapidly below 500 m. The evapotranspiration is around 400 mm per year and annual discharge around 659 mm. The daily precipitation, potential evaporation, and discharge data range from 1 January 2008 to 30 September 2014. The calibration period is from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010, and the data from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2014 is used as validation. The LiDAR-derived DEM map with 2 m resolution shows elevation ranging from 250 to 539 m (Fig. 6). There are seven saturation area maps (Fig. 7) (2 May, 2 July, 4 August, 3 September, 1 October, 26 November 2008, and 21 January 2009), measured directly by the “squishy boot” method and field mapping by the global positioning system (GPS), to delineate the boundary of saturation areas connected to the stream network (Birkel et al., 2010; Ali et al., 2014). These saturation area maps revealed a dynamic behavior of expanding and contracting areas connected to the stream network that were used as a benchmark test for the HSC module.	3.1	795	The Bruntland Burn catchment	4	1	Shrubland described	Multiple properties described	Glacier described	Topography described	N	N	N	25	183	6	2	2

139	\N	N/A	N/A	The HJAEF is located in the western Cascade Mountains of central Oregon (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of Pacific Northwest moist conifer forests. Watershed 2 (WS02) is 60 ha and the geology is dominated by bedrock of volcanic origin. Stream channels are steep and confined with unsorted sediment dominated by cobbles and boulders, with patches of silt and exposed bedrock. Shallow hillslope soils (generally less than 1 m deep) are loam and clay loam. Stone content ranges from 35 to 80%, increasing on south-facing slopes. The steep hillslopes in WS02 are dominated by 500- to 550-year-old Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mensiesii) forests with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) (Rothacher et al., 1967). The canopy is greater than 60 m tall. The climate is continental with cold winters and cool, short, dry summers. Annual precipitation averages 2300 mm, falling primarily as rain between  November and April and with occasional snow at higher elevations. Soil temperatures remain above freezing. The annual hydrograph in WS02 has a strong seasonal pattern with a high winter baseflow and frequent autumn, winter and spring stormflows in contrast to very low flows in summer (Fig. 14.3). Approximately 57% of the precipitation is streamflow (Post and Jones, 2001). Baseflow accounts for only 43% of the discharge (Q90/Q50 = 0.126) (Table 14.2) whereas quickflow comprises the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). McGuire et al. (2005) estimated that mean baseflow residence time for WS02, based on δO18 of water, was approximately 2.2 years. They suggested that topography and steepness may be exerting greater control on residence times than watershed area. Although there are no detectable trends in streamflow from 1987 to 2007, in more recent time periods (1996–2007) slight decreasing trends have been observed (Argerich et al., 2013). The relatively steep FDC for WS02 (Plates 11 and 12) has been attributed to highly permeable soils and strong seasonal precipitation patterns. Fast percolation rates, typically greater than 0.12 m/h, are influenced by high stone content and large pore spaces (Rothacher et al., 1967). These  characteristics also lead to substantial hyporheic flows lateral to and beneath the streams (Kasahara and Wondzell, 2003).	14.2.6	229	H.J.

140	\N	N/A	N/A	The HBEF is located in New Hampshire (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of mature northern hardwood stands. Vegetation at W3 is composed mainly of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The 42 ha watershed is mostly second growth and much of the HBEF was harvested in the 1910s (Table 14.1). Additional salvage harvesting occurred at the HBEF following the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. More recently, trees incurred some damage during the North American Ice Storm of 1998, with no apparent impact on annual runoff. The climate at the HBEF is cool and humid. On average, W3 receives 1350 mm of precipitation annually, which is distributed evenly throughout the year. Precipitation has increased by 25% during the record period, which is consistent with broader regional trends (Brown et al., 2010). Approximately one-third of precipitation falls as snow (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) and a snowpack generally persists from late December until mid-April. Soil frost forms during winter two out of every three years with an average annual maximum depth of 6 cm. The annual hydrograph shows a strong seasonal pattern with a peak during snowmelt runoff. Despite the higher flow during spring, floods can occur at any time of year when soil water deficits are reduced (Fig. 14.2). An increasing trend in precipitation has resulted in increasing trends in the magnitude of both low and high streamflows (Campbell et al., 2011). Approximately 64% of the precipitation that falls on the watershed becomes streamflow, with evapotranspiration comprising the remainder. Slight, but statistically significant declines in evapotranspiration have occurred in W3 (14% over 56 years) for reasons that are unknown. This decline appears to be due to local influences since similar trends are not consistently found at a larger regional scale. The relatively steep FCD for W3 (Plates 11 and 12) has traditionally been attributed to coarse, well-drained soils and mountainous topography that produce a flashy runoff response. Overland flow is also minimal because of the high infiltration capacity of the forest floor. In recent years, a more complete understanding of complex flow generation processes at the site has emerged. Data from a network of wells in W3 have revealed an intermittent, discontinuous water table (Detty and McGuire, 2010a; Gannon et al., 2014; Gillin et al., 2015). Stormflow generation is the result of lateral subsurface flow in the solum. Under some soil moisture conditions, small changes in groundwater can produce large changes in runoff, suggesting a threshold response that is related to flowpaths and soil transmissivity (Detty and McGuire, 2010b; Gannon et al., 2014). During low flows, only the near-stream zone is consistently hydrologically connected to the stream network. As the watershed wets up, more distal, previously isolated portions of the water table become hydrologically connected.	14.2.7	229	Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), reference watershed W3, New Hampshire	1	1	Vegetation described	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	95	143	1	2	2
141	\N	N/A	N/A	The MEF is located along the southern fringe of the boreal biome, in northern Minnesota (Fig. 14.1). The landscape includes uplands, peatlands, lakes and streams. Unlike mountainous research watersheds, streamflow typically is not bedrock controlled in the western lakes section where outwash sands, some >50 m deep, form large aquifers (Verry et al., 2011).  Aquifer–peatland connectivity varies between two peatland types: bogs and fens (Bay, 1967). In watersheds with either type, streamflow may originate from precipitation and flow along near-surface and shallow surface flowpaths in upland mineral soils (Verry et al., 2011). Bog watersheds may be perched due to loamy clay tills that retard the vertical flow of water from soils to the outwash aquifer (Verry et al., 2011). In fen watersheds, most streamflow, which may exceed streamflow from bogs by orders of magnitude during low flow, originates as discharge from aquifers and is perennial (Bay, 1967). The 10 ha S2 study watershed, with a bog (33% of the area), has low topographic relief (Table 14.1) with upland mineral soils that drain through peatland margins to an intermittent stream. Eleven to 33% of annual precipitation (456–981 mm) occurs as streamflow and 5–17% recharges the underlying aquifer (Nichols and Verry, 2001) (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Calculated evapotranspiration (precipitation – streamflow – recharge) has been 372–605 mm/year. Nine of the ten highest daily streamflows have occurred during rainfall–runoff events, not snowmelt or rain-on-snow events. Periods of no streamflow occur during any month and there has been no flow during 38% of the record (Plates 11 and 12), consistent with the zero value of Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2). Although most of the S2 area is uplands, most of the annual water budget (58%) comes from direct precipitation on the peatland (Verry et al., 2011). If the water table is >5–10 cm below the peatland surface, streamflow ceases and that storage must be replenished before resumption. Rainfall amount during summer exceeds snow water equivalents during winter and stormflows recess rapidly to no flow due to evapotranspiration. Melt from snow accumulation (November/December to March/April) results in several weeks of high flows (Sebestyen et al., 2011) (Fig. 14.2). Winter and spring frost in upland soils, exceeding 50 cm, prevents infiltration (Verry et al., 2011). Snowmelt waters flow overland until soils thaw in the spring, after which flow mostly occurs in the shallow subsurface through sandy loams above loamy clay horizons (Verry et al., 2011). Subsurface flow may persist for weeks until the upland deciduous forest begins transpiring. During large summer rainfall events, subsurface flow may last for several hours, but rarely longer.	14.2.8	230	Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), reference watershed S2, Minnesota	1	1	Vegetation described	Soil described	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	141	143	1	2	2
142	\N	N/A	N/A	The 25 ha watershed at SDEF is located in southern California (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the chaparral forests of the US Southwest. Chaparral forest is a dense, drought-tolerant shrubland with a closed canopy some 3–5 m in height. Chaparral is a fire-prone ecosystem and wildfires have burned the SDEF about every 40 years. Regional hydrology is controlled by climate and geology: cool, wet winters followed by long summer droughts; and ongoing tectonic uplift that has produced steep topography and exposed fractured crystalline basement rocks that weather to thin, coarse-textured, azonal soils (Dunn et al., 1988) (Table 14.1). Precipitation falls almost exclusively as rain from winter frontal storms and rare summer thunderstorms. Nearly 90% of the annual rainfall occurs between December and April with the most runoff in February (Fig. 14.2). Streamflow accounts for only roughly 11% of the rainfall, with the remainder apportioned to evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Groundwater dynamics on the SDEF are virtually unknown, rendering the closure of any water balance exercise moot. However, groundwater recharge is potentially large through the fractured substrate, reducing any calculated value of actual evapotranspiration. Soil moisture is at or below the wilting point by the end of the summer and the drought-adapted plants likely get their water from fractures in the bedrock. Stream runoff is generated by saturation excess flow in riparian zones, presumably as shallow throughflow moves laterally through the coarse soil mantle (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Infiltration-excess overland flow on hillside slopes is rare and occurs only during the most intense rainstorms, reflecting the high infiltration rates of the soil and percolation into bedrock. However, after wildfire, with the combustion of the canopy and surface litter layer as well as changes in soil properties (bulk density and water repellency), hillslope hydrology shifts to pervasive overland flow after saturation of the very thin surface wettable layer (Rice, 1974; DeBano, 1981). Water that formerly slowly flowed by subsurface pathways now moves quickly into the stream channels, increasing runoff for comparable storms by up to four orders of magnitude over pre-fire levels (Wohlgemuth, 2016). The effects of fire on the forest hydrology can persist for several years.	14.2.9	231	San Dimas Experimental Forest (SDEF), reference watershed Bell 3, California	1	2	Vegetation described	Soil described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	N	N	200	143	1	1	2
143	\N	N/A	N/A	The SEF is located in eastern South Carolina (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the subtropical coastal watersheds throughout much of the US Southeast, with hot and humid summers and moderate winter seasons. The 155 ha WS80 watershed is covered with a pine/mixed hardwood forest (Table 14.1), which has been undisturbed by management activities since 1936, but was heavily affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 that damaged >80% of the forest canopy (Hook et al., 1991).Seasonally, the winter is generally wet with low-intensity, long-duration rain events and rare snowfall. Summer is characterized by short-duration, high-intensity storm events and tropical depression storms are common. The seasonal runoff response to rain events is shown in Fig. 14.2. Approximately 22%, on average, of annual precipitation becomes runoff (Amatya et al., 2006), resulting in about 78%  evapotranspiration, assuming negligible seepage (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Approximately 60% of the runoff is contributed by shallow surface or runoff/rainwater, the rest by subsurface flow (Epps et al., 2013). Based on the FDC analysis this watershed produces flow only 56.3% of the time and hence has a zero value of Q90/Q50 (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2). The principal flow generation mechanism is driven by the shallow water table (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) (Harder et al., 2007; Epps et al., 2013), controlled primarily by rainfall and evapotranspiration, and minimally by deeper groundwater underlain by Santee Limestone approximately 20 m below the ground surface. The formation of an argillic horizon with poorly drained clayey subsoil provides a dynamic shallow groundwater table that has a complex non-linear relationship with streamflow (Harder et al., 2007). Saturation-excess surface and shallow subsurface runoff with rapid lateral transfers within the highly permeable upper soil layer may occur along reaches with flat topography. Surface depressional storage was shown to affect the surface runoff rate (Amoah et al., 2012). Runoff and peak flow at this watershed are dependent on both rainfall amount and intensity, as well as antecedent conditions reflected by initial water table positions (Epps et al., 2013). A key observation from WS80 is the reversal of the flow relationship between this and the treatment watershed, compared with the earlier calibration period, for a decade beginning three years after Hurricane Hugo severely damaged vegetation on both watersheds. As a result reduced evapotranspiration in selected hurricane-affected vegetation on the reference watershed enhanced its streamflow (Jayakaran et al., 2014). Long-term data also indicate rising air temperature and increasing frequency of large storms (Dai et al., 2013).	14.2.10	231	Santee Experimental Forest (SEF), reference watershed WS80, South Carolina	1	3	Vegetation described	Soil described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	204	143	1	1	2
144	\N	N/A	N/A	The general conceptual model of lateral preferential flow networks relies on the increase in soil wetness. As the soil wetness increases, there is an increase in the connections in the preferential flow network, causing faster subsurface velocities and increasing the area of hillslope contributing to runoff (Tsuboyama et al., 1994; Sidle et al., 2000; Uchida et al.,2005; Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006b). These excavations support this conceptual model. We observed that the preferential flow paths were connected by matrix flow through mineral and organic soils. In some areas, this saturated flow was perched above soil with low hydraulic conductivity and spread out horizontally in the overlying layers of more conductive soils. In other areas the flow had verti-\ncal components because the water was flowing downward to areas with higher conductivities. These observations showed that a connection may be established by increased soil wetness within a small localized area. The subsurface flow in this hillslope is highly dynamic and depends on the precipitation characteristics and antecedent condition. Trenched hillslopes from around the world have identified differences in subsurface flow characteristics based on the subsurface topography and the saturated zone connections of the hillslope and the trench (e.g. Tani, 1997; Hutchinson and Moore, 2000; Freer et al., 2002; Tromp van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006a). The excavations presented here show that trenches with large contributing areas collect flow from preferential flow networks that are efficient at transferring water, due in part to a high degree of hydraulic connectivity. The soils in these areas could transport water one order of magnitude faster than other soils (Anderson et al., 2009). The dye staining also revealed that there is often little interaction between water in the preferential flow path and the surrounding soil matrix unless there was a constriction in the preferential flow network.	4.2	942	Conceptual models of runoff	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	194	144	1	2	2

147	\N	N/A	N/A	During the pre-treatment period, a similar runoff response was observed for both catchments and the groundwater level was about 15–20 m below the stream invert (Ruprecht and Schofield, 1991). Following clearing, the deep, permanent groundwater system beneath the Lemon catchment started to rise due to lower evapotranspiration. Groundwater level intersected the surface by 1987 and by 1996 achieved a new stability (Bari and Smettem, 2004). After heavy rainfall, a shallow intermittent groundwater system develops on caprock or clay, saturates part of the stream zone and generates streamflow by saturation excess overland flow and interflow processes. Immediately following clearing, the flow duration of Lemon catchment increased and started flowing about a month earlier than Ernies catchment (Fig. 3a). The groundwater induced stream zone saturated area increased from nil before clearing to 8% of the catchment area in 1990s. There was an approximately 1400 mm increase in unsaturated soilwater storage (Bari and Smettem, 2004). When the groundwater system reached the stream bed, streamflow increased further, became perennial and in the dry summer months was dominated by the baseflow (Fig. 3b).	3	324	Streamflow generation process	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	123	147	1	2	2

149	\N	N/A	N/A	 a perceptual model of runoff generation and lateral flows was developed: rain water infiltrates into the upper soil layer in most parts of the basin; it then quickly reaches the less permeable second soil layer and generates temporary saturation above it; this temporary saturation is perceived to have two effects:(a) It will generate quick lateral downslope flow through macropores in the upper soil layer (pipeflow), particularly in the steeper downslope sections of the valley. This lateral flow will represent a mixture of infiltrated event water and of pre-event water 'pressed out' by the infiltrated event water, as described by McDonnell (1990). (b) It will cause percolation through the less permeable second soil layer at places where this layer is more permeable or penetrated (e.g. by roots etc.). The percolated water will then cause saturation on top of the bedrock with direct effects on basin discharge through pressure transfer to the valley floor and lower slopes. It will create immediate exfiltration of 'old' pre-event water into the channel (piston flow), as described by Anderson et al. (1997) In both cases, delays in peak flow of about two days are assumed to be caused by the time required for the percolation of water to and through the second soil layer, which may be rather short, and for the formation of saturated zones in the subsurface. This understanding is in agreement with the observation of large amounts of pre-event water in flood streamflow in similar basins (Herrmann et al, 1986; Pearce et al., 1986; McDonnell, 1990; Uhlenbrook & Leibundgut, 1997). Finally the considerable differences in the observed direct runoff amounts (overland and interflow) deserve comment. In the Schàfertal, direct overland flow ranges from about 1 % of precipitation (runoff/precipitation) for the first event up to 7% or 5.5% for the second and third events respectively (see Fig. 1). It is understood that this flow is generated from the few roads and pathways in the Schàfertal and from some impervious and temporarily saturated areas. In the Waldbach this component is more stable (about 3%) due to the fact that dynamically varying saturated areas did not occur during the three events. More informative is the analysis of interflow runoff. During the first event interflow only occurred in the Waldbach with about 3% of precipitation. It increases here to nearly 50% of precipitation in the second and third events (see Fig. 1). In the Schàfertal basin an interflow component was observed only for the second event (about 1.6%), and up to about 20% for the third one. This difference is considered to be caused by the different land uses in the two basins; forest in the Waldbach and agriculture in the Schàfertal.

200	\N	N/A	N/A	The catchment's hydrological response is driven by an interplay between surface and subsurface processes. One of its most characteristic features is its double peak runoff response, only occurring after a certain amount of catchment storage is exceeded (Martínez-Carreras et al., 2016). A first peak occurs almost simultaneously to rainfall and is mainly composed of event water, whereas the second peak is broader, lagged in time (several hours or days) and mainly composed of pre-event water (Martínez-Carreras et al., 2015; Wrede et al., 2015). Despite continuous refinement of the perceptual model of the WEC, a clear understanding of stream flow generation processes remains incomplete. Experimental studies suggest that lateral preferential flow through macropores along the hillslopes potentially contribute to the generation of the first peak of the hydrograph (Angermann et al., 2017; Martínez-Carreras et al., 2016). Modelling studies suggest that the first peak is solely generated by precipitation falling directly onto the stream and infiltration excess occurring in the riparian zone (Glaser et al., 2016, 2020; Rodriguez & Klaus, 2019). This finding is corroborated through high-resolution simulations of δ2H dynamics in the WEC, suggesting three distinct age components: catchment travel times from young water near the stream, weeks to a few years old water from hillslopes and weathered bedrock (saprock), and water with several years of mean travel times from weathered bedrock (saprock and saprolite) (Rodriguez & Klaus, 2019). 	2	2	SITE DESCRIPTION AND RESEARCH MOTIVATIONS	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	Uncertainty described	N	256	200	1	2	2
240	\N	N/A	N/A	This indicates that the stormflow reaches the stream largely through the soil by subsurface runoff due to high infiltration rates. [...] the soil can hold up to 60–70 % of water. This forms an important shallow subsurface water storage, which makes agriculture possible even in dry periods. Hence, this can lead to a shallow subsurface runoff component contributing to the total streamflow if the storage threshold is exceeded. [...] Therefore, it can be concluded from the rainfall-runoff response analysis that runoff generation at the Kansi and Migina catchments is dominated by subsurface flows as highly supported by the hydrograph separation [...] The observed dominance of old water (up to 80 %) in the Migina catchment confirms the finding of van den Berg and Bolt (2010) in their study during the dry season. They found that the locations of shallow groundwater in the Migina catchment are between 0.2 m and 2 m, which enables infiltrated rain to reach the groundwater quickly and contribute to subsurface stormflow and later to baseflow.	5	2000	Discussion	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	149	240	1	1	2

251	\N	N/A	N/A	(i) During dry conditions (soil moisture at 0–30 cm in the 35%–45% range), streamflow and hillslope water table were low. Small storms resulted in low runoff coefficients (Fig. 4) and stormflow generation was likely related to the response of the near-stream riparian zone that was prone to saturation and reactive to precipitation. The increase in stormflow with precipitation was 9% of the precipitation, which suggested that stormflow could volumetrically be explained by\nthe contribution of the entire riparian zone (representing approximately 9% of the total catchment area). Streamflow and soil moisture were very sensitive to rainfall inputs whereas groundwater was less reactive (Fig. 3). Streamflow response was faster than soil moisture measured on the hillslope, resulting in a clockwise hysteretic relationship between the two variables (Fig. 8a).\n(ii) As wetness increased, saturation in the riparian zone likely expanded laterally to the lower parts of hillslopes that are characterized by gentle slopes and shallow soils. Experimental evidence is not available to support this view but such a behaviour could be assumed based on a comparison of the topographic and geomorphologic properties of BCC with those of the Hitachi Ohta Watershed (e.g., incised morphology, shallow soils, steep slopes).\n(iii) With further increasing wetness, a moisture threshold was exceeded, resulting in a marked increase of streamflow (Fig. 5a) and likely the triggering of transient lateral subsurface flow on the hillslopes (Fig. 5b) as suggested by the abrupt increase in runoff coefficients above the 45% soil moisture threshold (Fig. 4) and the much larger increase in runoff depth with increasing precipitation (Fig. 9). A connection was likely established between the riparian area and hillslopes, which became hydrologically active zones. Response times changed compared to dry conditions: hillslope soil moisture peaked before streamflow, resulting in an anticlockwise hysteretic loop (Fig. 8b). Saturation overland flow over the hillslopes was not observed in the field during rainfall events and is assumed to be a negligible contribution to total catchment runoff. Therefore it is concluded that hillslope contributions to streamflow were most likely in the form of subsurface flow.	5	N/A	Towards a conceptual model of hydrological behaviour at BCC	2	3	N	Horizons described	N	Slopes described	N	Unknown items identified	N	189	251	2	5	2

258	\N	N/A	N/A	From the results of recent studies (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2004; Quinton et al., 2003), a conceptual model of runoff generation for the wetland-dominated basins of the lower Liard River valley has begun to develop. Peat plateaus represent areas of saturated permafrost that rise above the surrounding terrain. This enables them to effectively impound water in the bogs, while re-directing flow in the fens. Owing to their relatively high topographic position and the limited water storage capacity within their active layer, peat plateaus also shed water to the surrounding wetlands. The flowpath then followed by this drainage water depends upon the type of wetland that receives it. Water entering channel fens is more likely to be conveyed toward the basin outlet, than water entering bogs. This conceptual model contributes to resolving some of the difficult issues in the hydrological modelling of northern basins, especially in relation to the storage and routing functions of wetlands. Runoff-generation algorithms in hydrological models must account for the storage capacity of the bogs. Similarly, routing algorithms in distributed hydrological models need to incorporate the network of channel fens. Preliminary studies suggest that surface roughness and channel slope may be the essential factors controlling the flow of surface water in channel fens.

327	\N	N/A	N/A	The bedrock of the Kervidy-Naizin catchment is made up of fissured and fractured upper Brioverian schists. The catchment elevation ranges between 93 and 135 m above sea level and the steepest slopes do not exceed 10%. The climate is humid temperate: the mean annual rainfall recorded over the last 22 years is 713 mm, while the mean annual temperature and mean annual runoff recorded over the same period are 11 °C and 305 mm, respectively (Morel et al., 2009). Rainfall events rarely exceed 20 mm per day, and 80% of precipitations have intensity less than 4 mm per hour. Most of the storm events occur between November and March. Due to the small volume of water stored in the schist bedrock, the stream usually dries up from the end of August to the beginning of November. Ninety percent of the catchment area is dedicated to intensive agriculture, being composed mainly of pastures, maize and cereals for dairy production and pig breeding. Note that the intensive agriculture carried out on the Kervidy-Naizin catchment has led to heavy nitrate pollution with a mean nitrate concentration in the stream of around 70 mg L−1 (Molénat et al., 2008).\n\nSoils in the catchment have developed into a loamy material derived from bedrock weathering and aeolian Quaternary deposits. All the soils are classified as Luvisols. Nevertheless, the poor drainage in the bottomland domain leads to seasonal waterlogging with the development of hydromorphic soils. The hydrology of the catchment can be summarized by the contrast of two domains depending on water-table fluctuations: (i) a hillslope domain, where the water table always remains a few metres below the soil surface and is associated with essentially vertical water pathways, and (ii) a wetland domain where the water table usually reaches the soil surface during the wet season, namely, winter and spring (Molénat et al., 2008). The extent of this wetland domain is highly variable, ranging from 5% to 20% of the total surface area of the catchment depending on hydroclimatic conditions (Gascuel-Odoux et al., 1998).\n\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) contents show two well marked gradients (Morel et al., 2009): (i) a rapid and strong decrease with depth: e.g. from 4.4% at 0–10 cm depth to 0.1% at 80–100 cm depth in wetland areas close to the stream network, and (ii) a progressive decline with increasing distance to the stream network: e.g. from 4.4% at 0–10 cm close to the stream down to 0.9% at 0–10 cm, 400 m away from the stream.\n\nPrevious studies focusing on water pathways and solute sources in the Kervidy-Naizin catchment showed that the uppermost soils of the wetland areas (between 0 and 30 cm depth) are the main sources of DOC and waters during storm events, accounting for 60–85% and 35% of the DOC and water fluxes, respectively (Mérot et al., 1995, Durand and Torres, 1996, Gascuel-Odoux et al., 1998, Molénat et al., 1999, Morel et al., 2009). More specifically, four water reservoirs have been identified as contributing to the stream flow in this catchment: (i) rainfall; (ii) deep (>3 m) groundwater; (iii) wetland soil water (including wetland runoff); and (iv) shallow (between 1 and 3 m deep), hillslope groundwater (Mérot et al., 1995, Durand and Torres, 1996, Morel et al., 2009). Of these four end-members, only the last two contribute significantly to the stream DOC, while the contribution of the deep groundwater and rainfall end-members always remains very low (<3%; see Morel et al., 2009).	2.1	229	Site Description	2	1	Vegetation described	Soil types described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	N	N	113	327	2	2	2

329	\N	N/A	N/A	Almost 40 years after the suspension of grazing, we find no evidence that water from the uplands is being routed to drainage areas at LCRA. These findings are contrary to the prevailing hypothesis that drainage areas continue to receive water subsidies and are more mesic than the uplands (Archer 1995, Wu and Archer 2005, Parker et al 2010). During the 20 months of our study, overland flow was nonexistent despite some relatively large rainfall events. Our soil moisture measurements also provide strong evidence that there is little if any redistribution of water from the uplands to the lower-lying drainage-woodlands. If such redistribution were occurring, there would be dramatic differences in soil moisture between the two landforms. For example, in banded vegetation drylands of Australia, soil moisture levels were 5 times higher in downslope tree groves than in adjacent upland intercanopy areas (Ludwig et al 2005). In contrast, our measurements showed insignificant differences in soil moisture. Further, our comparison of soil infiltrability and field saturated hydraulic conductivity between our ungrazed study site and the nearby grazed site demonstrates that even moderate grazing pressure dramatically diminished soil infiltrability and likely led to much higher surface runoff. Weltz and Blackburn (1995) monitored runoff from large (5 m × 7 m) plots over a 20-month period at our study site and found that runoff was still being generated from the upland areas 40 years ago (soon after the removal of livestock). They found that for rainfall events larger than 100 mm, runoff could be as high as 8% of rainfall. It is quite likely that 150 years ago, when the site was subjected to severe overgrazing, runoff from the uplands into the drainage areas was much higher.\n\nThe prevailing evidence suggests that relaxation of grazing along with an increase in woody plants has greatly reduced hydrologic connectivity between the uplands and the drainage areas—which could explain the complete cessation of subsidy inputs to the drainage-woodlands. We postulate that at our site, the drainage areas were more mesic under the overgrazed conditions of the past, owing to a more ecohydrologically connected state. While fire suppression and grazing may have been the primary triggers for recruitment and expansion of woody plants, it is likely that the greater water availability in the drainage-woodlands made this location more favorable for WPE. This proposition is supported by the higher SOC accumulation and the greater mean age of stands in the drainage-woodlands, noted by Boutton et al (1998). In other words, the hydrological state of the landscape must have been a crucial factor in determining the patterns of recruitment in the earlier stages of WPE.

316	\N	N/A	N/A	Hortonian overland flow is very rare in the Grasslands Research Catchment in Zimbabwe. Instead, it is hypothesised, supported by field observation, that satu­ration overland flow, generated solely within the area of the dambo, is the major mechanism of storm runoff production in the catchment. […] On 26/01/96 and 09/02/96, antecedent conditions within the catchment were similar and the watertable was either at or very close to the ground surface over much of the dambo on both days […] The relationship between storm characteristics and 'new' water contributions to stormflow suggests that the response across the dambo varies over short time periods. Within the dambo, where the soil profile is not completely saturated, the closeness of the perched watertable to the ground surface probably ensures that the capillary fringe (i.e. the region above the watertable which is under ten­sion but remains close to saturation) will extend to the sur­face. Under such circumstances, application of only a small amount of water can result in a large and rapid rise of the watertable (Jayatilika and Gillham, 1996), and the extent of expansion of the saturated region will be very sensitive to the amount and, to a lesser extent, to the intensity of rainfall.

355	\N	N/A	N/A	In  this  region  the  hydrological  dynamics  of  the   alluvial aquifer are determined by seasonal surface runoff.  Because of shallow soils, runoff primarily takes the form  of Hortonian overland flow. Runoff is only observed after  the first heavy rainfalls of the rainy season. Most runoff in this period comes from intense rainfall events followed by  periods  without  precipitation  of  variable  duration  (1  day   to 2 months).Over the past decade, the manual drilling of  shallow wells (< 10 m) in the alluvial aquifer has contributed  to the development of small-scale (< 5 ha) irrigated forage  and  horticultural  fields.  However,  irrigation  restrictions   due  to  the  salinity  of  the  alluvial  groundwater  appeared   after 2-3 years of crops, leading local farmers in search of  other sources of water for irrigation. Since 2005 the large  volume of water stored in the Riacho Verde reservoir (RV  in  FIG.  1)  has  made  it  possible  to  release  water  into  the   Forquilha river during the dry season, making it perennial  down to the end of Section 2 (FIG. 2).\n\nThe increase in salinity after the floods of 2004 may be accounted for by either contribution from the crystalline bedrock or leaching from the unsaturated zone. The difference in salt mass between pre-flood baseline values (t0) and values 27 and 90 days after the flood (t27 and t90) measured at the three piezometers makes it possible to calculate the amount of salt required to produce the observed increase (TAB. 3; FIG. 6). The balance was carried out to test the hypothesis that salinity increased after the flood of 2004 due to the leaching of salts accumulated by evaporation in the unsaturated zone since the previous peak flood. The salinity of the groundwater near the river decreased due to dilution by direct infiltration of low-salinity (0.07 g L-1) runoff water along the river bed; that is the case of P101. On the contrary, the groundwater salinity farther from the aquifer (P111 and P113) increased considerably due to the leaching of 1 to 2 kg m-2 of salts (compare M values pre/post-flood in TAB. 3) from the unsaturated zone (hypothesis 1) or due to the discharge of saline water through crevices in the bedrock (hypothesis 2, FIG. 6). When the level of the river falls, the river-to-aquifer flow is reverted allowing saline water to drain into the river, explaining the salinity peak observed at P101. Ninety days after the flood, when the water level of the river and the aquifer was nearly the same, the salinity was similar at P101 and P111, but still differed at P113 due to the greater distance from the river. In an earlier study of the soils in this area (2002), a drainage test yielded a salt concentration of 3 g L-1 in leached water. This is even higher than the concentration considered in the present study (1.52 and 2.04 g L-1).\n	N/A	636 & 641	Materials and methods & Salt mass balance	1	2	N	N	Bedrock described	N	N	N	salinity study	71	355	1	3	2

317	\N	N/A	N/A	In this small Mediterranean research catchment, dominated by the SSF mechanism of runoff production, the relationship between rainfall and storm-flow depth at the event scale confirmed the strong non-linearity of these two variables, as has also been shown in other Mediterranean catchments (Ceballos and Schnabel, 1998; Martınez- Mena et al., 1998; Latron and Gallart, 2007, Lana-Renault et al., 2007). The storm-flow coefficient was mainly related to soil moisture and water-table depth, with values higher than 2% only during the wet winter period, suggesting that subsurface flow played a primary role in runoff production at the basin scale. The seasonal dynamics of soil moisture, water-table depth and stream discharge observed at the valley bottom of the Baratz catchment enabled us to recognize three seasonal periods of the water year, characterised by different dominant runoff formation processes: 1) summer and autumn, which have high water-table depths, low soil moisture and no stream discharge even when there is intense rainfall, which infiltrates into the soil and increases the water content and water-table level, without producing HOF; 2) winter, which has low water-table depths, high soil moisture and storm-flow generated by the SOF over saturated areas and by the SSF through pipes, macropores and seepage zones in the soil; 3) spring, which has low water-table depths, low soil moisture and slow baseflow generated by the exfiltration of SSF through the soil matrix. These results indicate that the dominant mechanism in runoff formation is the SSF, which gives rise to baseflow, controls the saturated areas formation and enters streams quickly enough to contribute to the stormflow together with the SOF, while the HOF mechanism can be ignored.

321	\N	N/A	N/A	We interpret that groundwater discharge dominates headwater streamflow generation in the merokarst of N04D, during both high and low flow conditions (Fig. 8). Contributions from surface runoff are only important during some storms, and contributions from soil water are volumetrically insignificant across the entire wet season. These behaviors are in contrast to the widespread shallow-and-deep hypothesis of streamflow generation, which states that contributions to streamflow from shallow units (i.e. surface runoff and soil water) become increasingly more important relative to deep units (i.e. groundwater) under wet conditions. While studies conducted at non-karstic catchments of similar size to N04D generally support the shallow-and-deep hypothesis, we hold that the karstic properties of N04D prevent the development of such a regime. Thin soils place an upper limit on the significance of shallow flow paths, while soil macropores and bedrock fractures rapidly route water to limestone aquifers ensuring that deep flow paths remain dominant even during very wet conditions. Given that groundwater flow paths are critical in sustaining streamflow, our finding that there are groundwater storage thresholds which govern subsurface connections to the stream then implies that these thresholds are major controllers on stream intermittency. Significant, sustained streamflow can only occur when enough precipitation has fallen in a short enough amount of time to surpass the groundwater storage thresholds.\nThe thinly bedded nature of the limestones at N04D means that its hydrological behavior also deviates from what is typically seen in massive karst systems. Confining mudstone layers largely restrict vertical movement of water between limestones and the unique depositional history of each individual limestone bed means that each one might possess unique hydrogeological properties. Whether caused by differences in hydraulic conductivity or simple stratigraphic position, our results show that each of our studied limestone aquifers, which are vertically separated by only a couple of meters from one another, respond to recharge and interact with the stream in different ways (Fig. 4). This heterogeneity expands the capacity of the subsurface to act as a hydrological buffer, in that each limestone unit releases recharge into the stream at a different rate to effectively extend the amount of time that the stream can flow. Consistent with this observation, streams across the Flint Hills region of Kansas have greater proportions of baseflow in total streamflow than streams in adjacent, non-merokarstic regions,62 suggesting that the merokarst bedrock does improve hydrological buffering.	4.6	128	Implications	1	1	N	N	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	252	321	1	2	2
388	\N	N/A	N/A	Sleepers River was the site of Tom Dunne's seminal research on the partial area concept for streamflow generation (Dunne & Black, 1970a, 1970b, 1971), and was the site where Eric Anderson of the National Weather Service (NWS) developed the energy balance snowmelt model still in use today for flood forecasting (Anderson, 1968, 1973). Early U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research at SRRW in the 1990s extended the hydrologic legacy, applying newer isotopic and chemical approaches, and introducing biogeochemical research. Shanley et al. (1995) used water isotopes and solute chemistry to show that ice layers within snowpacks temporarily impeded meltwater infiltration. The isotopic approach combined with frozen ground measurements demonstrated that deep frost shunts meltwater directly to the stream locally (Shanley et al., 2015), but over larger scales the effect of ground frost is minimal (Shanley & Chalmers, 1999). Kendall et al. (1999) used solute chemistry of hillslope groundwater to show that hillslopes are not always well-connected to the stream, and Hjerdt (2002) extended this work to show that hillslope contributions were focused in convergent hollows. The extensive subsurface chemical database combined with stream event sampling have supported findings that subsurface, chemically evolved ‘old’ water dominates the high-flow hydrograph (Porter et al., this issue; Kendall et al., 1999; McGlynn et al., 1999; Saiers et al., 2021; Sebestyen et al., 2008; Stewart et al., 2021). Shanley et al. (2002) used water isotopes to show that this old water dominated even in the headwater realm, and did not increase with basin scale as hypothesized.	2	1	Introduction	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	216	388	1	2	2

In a hillslope with a thin soil cover underlain by a weathered bedrock (or saprock) layer, the bulk of the precipitation rapidly infiltrates soils and saprock and forms limited lateral PF on the soil–saprock interface. Lateral PF may take place through the horizontal fissures in the saprock and form return flow downslope. Once water encounters a fresh bedrock surface, a transient water table may perch at small depressions and then trigger lateral PF downslope.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	1	1	N	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	213	98	1	2	1

385	\N	N/A	N/A	The Buck Creek and Boreas River watersheds and WASS and ECASS streams lie within the Adirondack Ecological Region (McNab & Avers, 1994), which roughly corresponds to the boundary of the 24 243 km2 Adirondack State Park (Figure 1). The Adirondack region is almost entirely forested and is the largest state park in the United States. Repeated glaciations that last receded 10 000 years ago have left rugged terrain. Bedrock geology is a complex mixture of granitic and gneissic rocks with a variety of less common metasedimentary formations scattered throughout the region (Roy et al., 1997). Surficial deposits reflect this complexity and include highly weatherable calcareous minerals in some areas (Roy et al., 1997). Mean annual precipitation ranges from approximately 800 to over 1600 mm across the region (Ito, Mitchell, & Driscoll, 2002). Below-freezing temperatures occur through most of the winter, and with the onset of spring in late March or early April accumulated snow melts over several weeks causing high sustained streamflows.\n\nIn North Buck (area 27 ha), organic-rich soils directly overlie bedrock in all but the lowest area of the watershed where some thin till deposition has occurred. As a result, the stream is prone to becoming dry during periods in the late growing season (August–September). A wetland with a floating vegetation mat, 0.75 ha in area, occurs near the top of the watershed, adjacent to a forested area with moss-covered perennially wet soils covering an area of 0.25 ha. The forest is a mixture of hardwood and conifer species. The most abundant canopy tree is red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), followed by red maple (Acer rubrum L.), beech, (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.). Coniferous litter contributes to a thick forest floor that averages greater than 21 cm (Oe plus Oa horizons). Soils and stream water are dominated by organic acidity that results in stream pH values that rarely exceed 4.5 (Lawrence, Scanga, & Sabo, 2020).\n\nIn South Buck (area 52 ha), till deposits play a larger hydrologic role, maintaining continuous flow even during extreme dry periods and providing acid neutralization that is well expressed during base flow. Beech is the most abundant overstory tree species, but sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), and a few red spruce are also present in the canopy. Soils are less influenced by organic matter than North Buck but are also extremely acidic. The average forest floor thickness is less than 10 cm, which reflects hardwood litter that decomposes more readily than conifer litter. The acidic soils overlying acid-neutralizing till result in stream pH values ranging widely from 4.5 to over 6.5 with variations in streamflow (Lawrence, Scanga, & Sabo, 2020).	3	4	SITE DESCRIPTIONS	2	1	Vegetation species described	Soil described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	26	385	10	2	2

160	\N	N/A	N/A	In the Upper Aguima catchment surface runoff occurs only on pathways (Hortonian overland flow) or at the bottom of the hillslope (saturated overland flow), when the inland valley is saturated during the rainy season. But as inland valleys only occur at 1/3 of the channel length of the Upper Aguima, this process is not as important as in the Upper Niaou, where the whole river is characterized by inland valleys (Giertz and\nDiekkr ̈uger, 2003). Due to the high macroporosity in soils of natural Grassland and woodland vegetation, the infiltration rates are very high. The low permeability of the subsoil of Lixisols and Plinthosols results in subsurface flow processes, which can be considered as the prevailing processes on the hillslopes.	3	831	Hydrological Processes	2	1	Grassland described	Soil hydraulic properties described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	N	N	5	160	3	2	2

187	\N	N/A	N/A	The major processes identified include on-channel precipitation and near-channel overland flow, which are thought to be important sources of direct snowmelt and rainfall runoff. In unsaturated off-channel areas infiltration capacity is often too high for these processes to occur. In wetlands, mixed water sources are delivered to the stream via fill and spill, which involves event water raising the groundwater table until depression storage is satisfied and then flow occurs. Macropore flow involves flow of mixed water predominantly through organic soils and interflow/return flows are shallow groundwaters that flow between mineral soil and peat, contributing either to fill and spill or macropore flow. The fill and spill process also applies to larger bodies of surface water including lakes and ponds that are often connected by permanent outlets to the tributaries. Flow from these sources is isotopically labelled as surface water due to exposure to evaporative isotopic enrichment. Groundwater sources also include shallow flow in drift aquifers and deeper sources, including bedrock aquifers or regional groundwater. In general, the residence time of water increases from runoff component (1) through to (8) (see Fig. 12). Deeper groundwater sources also tend to be more important lower down in the drainage network as the channels become more incised, in places within bedrock. If groundwater ridging is occurring in the watersheds, then it must lead to interaction with organic soils, otherwise we would not see increases in both groundwater and surface water contributions during the freshet or during rain events. Translatory flows appear to dominate runoff. Microtopography (hollows and hummocks) in organic terrain is important in the fill and spill process because it promotes subsurface interactions (Frei et al., 2010) and translatory flows. The fate of event water, if it does not fall in near-channel areas, is to become mixed with groundwater if recharged, or surface water if it lands on saturated wetlands and is exposed to evaporation.	4	144	Discussion	2	1	N	Multiple properties described	N	Topography described	N	N	N	12	187	8	2	2

192	\N	N/A	N/A	To study the characteristics of four rainfall events, we can clearly find that the rainfall intensity has a significant temporal change. In the process of rainfall events, the rain intensity is less than the infiltration capacity at some times and sometimes greater than the infiltration capacity. When rainfall intensity is greater than soil infiltration capacity, excess infiltration will occur in places where the soil water content reached the saturated moisture content, which will increase the proportion of event water to the total discharge in the channel (storm 1). Rainfall intensity of storm 2 is the smallest that will result in the raindrops in the ground infiltrating along the vertical section of the soil layer. Infiltration of the event water will replace the pre-event water in the unsaturated or saturated zone, making the percentage of pre-event water contribution to discharge larger, and precipitation relative to the watershed water storage capacity can be ignored, so the event water cannot completely replace the pre-event water. The remaining event water contribution of 1.7% in storm 2 may be mainly due to the direct rainfall onto the channel or impervious surface which will rapidly collect to a watershed export as event water. The contribution of pre-event water also related to the characteristics of landscape organization. Hemuqiao experimental watershed is located in the humid mountainous area of Southeast China, which has a relatively thin thickness of unsaturated zone (1.5–2.5 m) and high permeable soil covered well with plants. The main runoff generation pattern of this region is repletion of storage, which means that runoff is generated until soil moisture reaches field capacity, and the excess rainfall will flow out of the watershed as event water. However, this theory may be not used to reveal the runoff process in mountainous watershed covered with bamboo. Storm 2 has relatively wet antecedent condition and shows the highest proportion of pre-event water which indicates that the growth and development of plant roots might probably result in macropore flow being widespread in bamboo forest soil. Hemuqiao watershed is covered mainly by bamboo (90%), and the rest is covered by potato, tea and other crops. The vegetation cover is one of the important factors which impacts the proportion of pre-event water. 	5.2	11	Runoff Generation Mechanism	1	2	Multiple land-covers described	Multiple properties described	N	N	N	Uncertainty described	N	90	192	1	3	2

194	\N	N/A	N/A	Using available soil and topography information for the catchment (DEW, 2016; Hall et al., 2009; DEWNR, 2016), we first developed a conceptual model to outline the most likely processes leading to streamflow generation and the resulting dominant streamflow generation for Pedler Creek (Table 2). We identified the following three major areas with distinctive characteristics: (1) the steep hills to the east, (2) the undulating hills to the north, and (3) the flat valley in the southwestern area of the catchment (Fig. 3a). These three areas provide a spatial understanding of the most likely streamflow generating processes, with different processes and areas of the catchment contributing to the short ephemeral flows during summer and late fall, the early winter buildup to intermittent flow, and, throughout the rainy season, continuous flow. A detailed description of the processes for each area and the spatiotemporal development of the most likely dominant streamflow generation component for intermittent flow is provided below (Fig. 3b–d).\n2.2.1 Steep hills; fast flow\nThe steep hills are characterised by a permeable and shallow (top 0.5 m) loam soil underlain by a heavy clay profile with steep slopes (Fig. 3b). The combination of the shallow loam soil permeability, the high infiltration capacity, and the steep slopes are likely to allow the water to infiltrate and to flow relatively fast as unsaturated IF towards the stream (Fig. 3b1–2). We hypothesise that the shallow loam soil profile and the water holding capacity of the loam will promote a perched GW mounding along the riverine area, which will result in SE-OF from the riverine area and the adjacent hillslope developing as the dominant streamflow generation mechanism (Fig. 3b3). We hypothesise that this area contributes heavily to the temporally isolated ephemeral flows and the dominant flow generation mechanism for these events would be infiltration excess overland flow.\n2.2.2 Undulating hills; slow flow\nThe undulating hills consist of a highly permeable deep (top 1.1 m) sandy soil profile underlain by a heavy clay layer with mild slopes (Fig. 3b). We expect that the high soil infiltration capacity and permeability of the sand will result in a large infiltration rate allowing most of the early winter precipitation to infiltrate in this area (Fig. 3c4; Blasch et al., 2006; Batlle-Aguilar and Cook, 2012; Mihevc et al., 2002). As the infiltrated water reaches the low permeable clay layer, it will move in the subsurface as IF towards the low-gradient areas (Fig. 3c5). We hypothesise that the high infiltration rates in combination with the mild slopes (or low-gradient areas in the valley) will favour the development of a perched GW that will rise uniformly, allowing the river to develop into a gaining condition. As the infiltrated water moves as IF it will discharge into the downstream areas (Fig. 3c6). Due to the larger unsaturated storage and the mild slopes, this area will likely take longer to contribute to flow (i.e. more water and, therefore, more time will be needed to reach the threshold of flow generation). We hypothesise that these areas will therefore provide the slow flows necessary to sustain intermittent flow for the days without rainfall during the intermittent season, and conversely, they are not likely to contribute to flow during ephemeral events (Fig. 3e).\n2.2.3 Flat valley; mixed flows\nThe flat valley comprises a mix of the previous two soil profiles (deep sand and shallow loam underlain by heavy clay) and a heavy clay area, all located in a low-gradient topography (Fig. 3d). The GW becomes shallower near the riverine areas in the valley and depth to GW decreases towards the outlet area (the bore with the shallowest GW is located near the outlet where the GW is ∼ 2 m below surface elevation). This zone has the largest draining area with both the steep and undulating hills draining towards it. The diversity of conditions in this area is likely to result in a combination of the processes previously discussed and additional ones. We hypothesise that the processes originating in the sandy soil areas in the valley will be similar to those on the undulating hills, with the difference that the unsaturated IF that might originate early during the season might only contribute with a small amount of flow that might reflect further downstream. We also expect to see some saturated/unsaturated IF originating early in the season in the loam areas in the valley (Fig. 3d.8–9). However, we hypothesise that the low-gradient terrain, along with the water holding capacity of the loam soil, will slow down water moving as interflow and rather promote the soil saturation to build up in the shallow soil profile. As the saturation increases, we expect the dominant streamflow generation mechanism will switch to saturation excess overland flow from both the hillslope and the river area.\nThe clay's low permeability will limit infiltration and favour water to pond on the surface on the clay areas, which will eventually result in infiltration excess overland flow (Fig. 3d10–11​​​​​​​). The large draining area of the valley, combined with the low-gradient topography, is likely to promote the development of a perched GW along the riverine area, which will result in SE-OF along some sections of the river (Fig. 3d9). During wet years, sections of the creek near the outlet where GW is shallow are likely to develop into a gaining state with old GW contributing to streamflow (Fig. 3d10). Once the saturation threshold has been met along the riverine area in the steep hills and throughout the loam areas in the valley, SE-OF from those areas and the IE-OF from the clay are likely to contribute with the fast flows as travel times for overland flow are generally smaller than those for subsurface processes (Fig. 3b).	2.2	4303	Conceptual model of streamflow generation process in Pedler Creek	3	3	N	Multiple properties described	N	Topography described	N	N	N	172	194	4	1	2

198	\N	N/A	N/A	For the investigated areas with predominating podzoluvisols, we postulate the following hypothesis on the essential processes of runoff generation due to snowmelt (compare Fig. 7): in summer, with negative soil water balance, macropores and hence preferential flow paths are formed due to clay shrinkage in the upper Bt-horizon and in its (diagnostic) interlocking area with the E-horizon. A deeper saturated soil reservoir (excess water typically occurring in podzoluvisols) is filled by infiltrating precipitation water. In autumn, the size of macro-pores is reduced due to wetting of the soil and clay swelling. However, due to typical tonguing of the E-horizon (coarser grained material) into the Bt-horizon, the discussed soil area remains more or less permeable. During winter, this soil state is conserved. Therefore, infiltrating snowmelt water in spring is more or less retained in upper soil horizons before it enters into the saturated reservoir. In an advanced infiltration stage, water is displaced from the saturated reservoir due to hydraulic  connection to infiltration water and pressure transmission.	3	117	Modelling of snowmelt and spring flood events	1	3	N	Multiple properties described	N	N	N	N	N	116	198	1	1	2

291	\N	N/A	N/A	Studies on the micro-scale (Boy et al., 2008; Goller et al., 2005), supported by solute data and end member mixing analysis at the meso-scale (Bücker et al., 2011; Crespo et al., 2012), showed that fast “organic horizon flow” in forested catchments dominates during discharge events if the mineral soils are water saturated prior to the rainfall. Due to an abrupt change in saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) between the organic (38.9 m d−1) and the near-surface mineral layer (0.15 m d−1), this organic horizon flow can contribute up to 78 % of the total discharge during storm events (Fleischbein et al., 2006; Goller et al., 2005). However, the overall importance of this organic horizon flow is still disputable because the rainfall intensity rarely gets close to such a high saturated hydraulic conductivity. In 95 % of the measured rainfall events between June 2010 and October 2012 the intensity was below 0.1 m d−1 (≈ 4.1 mm h−1) and was therefore 15 times lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the mineral soil layer below the organic layer under forest vegetation and around 30 times lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil under pasture vegetation (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Crespo et al., 2012). The same conclusion holds true for the occurrence of surface runoff due to infiltration access on pasture (lacking a significant organic layer). Solely based on rainfall intensities, surface runoff is therefore relatively unlikely to contribute to a larger extent in rainfall–runoff generation. The reported Ksat values are based on measurements of 250 cm3 undisturbed soil core samples vertically extracted from the center of each respective layer. Due to the chosen sampling method and the limited size of the soil cores, the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity will be even higher and can vary for the horizontal flow component. When and to which extent a subsurface saturated prior to the rainfall event would still trigger surface runoff on pastures therefore remains to be investigated. Bücker et al. (2010) and Timbe et al. (2014) were able to show that base flow, on the other hand, has a rather large influence on the annual discharge volume across different land use types, accounting for > 70 and > 85 %, respectively. These findings are also supported by the long MTT of the base flow for different sub-catchments of the Rio San Francisco in comparison to the fast runoff reaction times, varying according to Timbe et al. (2014) between 2.1 and 3.9 years. Accordingly, the current findings confirm that the base flow – originating from deeper mineral soil and bedrock layers–is dominating the overall hydrological system in the study area (Crespo et al., 2012; Goller et al., 2005). Apart from this dominating source of base flow, Bücker et al. (2010) identified near-surface lateral flow as a second component to be relevant for the generation of base flow for pasture sites.	2.3	4116	Current process understanding at the catchment scale	2	1	Multiple land-covers described	Soil hydraulic properties described	N	N	N	N	N	188	291	8	2	2

376	\N	N/A	N/A	In the catchment Obere Brachtpe, essential and fundamental findings on the impact of topography and soil moisture on subsurface connectivity and runoff generation were also obtained. The analysis of temporally high-resolution groundwater data in relation to the discharge of the receiving stream during several rainfall/runoff events has shown the influence of slope form, and the flat riparian zone on the runoff processes (Chifflard, 2006). Due to the convergent slope form, subsurface stormflow is concentrated at the bottom of the convergent hillslope. Because of the small slope inclination in the flat riparian zone, the velocity of subsurface water flow is reduced, and groundwater from the slope is transported to the channel with a time lag. As a consequence of this delayed groundwater flow, the runoff in the receiving stream increases again following the initial peak. According to the findings of (Chifflard et al., 2010), delayed peaks are a fundamental indicator of the contribution of subsurface runoff.\n\nThe influence of the antecedent soil moisture on runoff generation was quantified by multiple regression analyses of rainfall, pre-event discharge, single-point soil moisture profiles from representative locations and peak discharge, discharge duration, discharge volume, based on 137 single rainfall-runoff events (Chifflard et al., 2018; Chifflard & Zepp, 2008). The evaluation of the extensive dataset shows that the number of explanatory variables in the regression models is lower in winter (up to three variables) than in summer (up to eight variables), and higher for the mesoscale catchment (Hüppcherhammer) than for the small catchment (Husten) (up to two variables). In addition, it was shown that soil moisture data from selected key sites (plot size) in the small catchment improved the quality of the regression models constructed for the mesoscale catchment. This indicates the varying importance of the soil moisture, depending on which characteristics of the discharge are focused on. Based on this intensive data evaluation, it can be concluded that point data for soil moisture in functional landscape elements describe the system condition of catchments very well, and can provide valuable information for flood forecasting in mountain landscapes with subsurface runoff.	4	4	Research Findings	2	2	N	N	N	Topography described	N	N	N	165	377	3	1	2
377	\N	N/A	N/A	In the catchment Bohlmicke, the results obtained at different spatial scales show that the periglacial cover beds have a strong influence on both soil-water dynamics on the plot scale, and runoff dynamics on the catchment scale. These results emphasize the importance of cover beds in the generation of subsurface runoff and, additionally, in subsurface connectivity in a subdued relief. It has to be highlighted that the basal layer shows a temporally variable influence on soil-water fluxes, dependent on antecedent soil moisture, the latter being defined as initial soil moisture at the onset of a runoff event. On one hand, the basal layer functions as a barrier for vertical water flow when soil moisture is low; while on the other hand, it is a preferential pathway for lateral subsurface runoff in the case of high soil moisture. The temporal variability of subsurface connectivity between lower slope positions and the stream has been proven by the combination of tracer-hydrological (catchment scale) and hydrometric measurements (plot scale) during different rainfall/runoff events (Figure 3). This has shown that the intermediate and basal layers influence soil-water dynamics and runoff generation in different ways, depending on antecedent soil moisture (Chifflard et al., 2008; Moldenhauer et al., 2013).	4	4	Research Findings	1	2	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	21	377	1	5	2

381	\N	N/A	N/A	The catchment is characterized by complex hydrogeology formed during the last glaciation about 10–15 k years BP (Gelbrecht et al., 2005). The southern part is in a glacial meltwater valley with glacio-fluvial sediments prevalent extending from Warsaw to Berlin (Figure 1b), where the catchment outlet discharges water into Lake Dehmsee and subsequently into the River Spree. The more elevated northern part of the catchment is dominated by freely draining unconsolidated ground moraines, with glacio-fluvial sands and gravels prevalent in the South. Soils are freely draining and have a high fraction of sand (Table 1), though the northerly soils associated with the ground moraine have a higher silt content and retain more water (Figure 1c). Near the stream and in depressions, peat deposits are extensive and remain close to saturation throughout the year. Kettle holes are abundant as depressions in the landscape and are strongly influenced by groundwater (Nitzsche et al., 2017). These small water bodies provide important habitats and ecosystem services (Biggs et al., 2017). The finer soils in the northern and eastern parts of the catchment are used for agricultural production (Table 1, Figure 1d). Multiple peatlands and fens exist along the stream network that are partly used as meadows. Land use gradually changes to forestry towards the southern region of the catchment (Figure 1d). Large parts of the catchment's forest cover are dominated by stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) which were intensively managed in the past. More recent management aims to enhance mixed and broadleaved forests (Lasch et al., 2002). The catchment has been historically drained, and fields in wetter areas are widely underlain with tile drainages. There is no irrigation being applied for agriculture. The anthropogenically influenced stream network (Nützmann et al., 2011) is highly drought-sensitive (Kleine et al., 2020) with flows being intermittent during dry periods (Smith, Tetzlaff, Gelbrecht, et al., 2020). Drainage and the connection of glacial hollows which formerly had no surface outflow expanded the channel network from 20 km (1790) to 88 km (Nützmann et al., 2011). This results in a transformed hydrology, channel morphology, aquatic habitats, and nutrient cycling (Blann et al., 2009). Overall, streamflow generation in the catchment is dominated by groundwater; the catchment has a strong seasonal flow regime, with highest flows generally in winter. Runoff coefficients during storm events are <5% indicating limited contributions from restricted areas of saturated or compacted soils, as well as sealed (urban/road) surfaces (Smith, Tetzlaff, Gelbrecht, et al., 2020).	2	N/A	Study Site	1	1	Vegetation types described	Soil described	Geological types described	Topography described	N	N	N	53	381	1	2	2

395	\N	N/A	N/A	In the Kuparuk, as snow melts in the spring, frozen ground limits soil water storage and enhances water runoff to the river network (figure 2(B)). With the snowmelt comes large pulses of water that is rich in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM, respectively) and associated nutrients, which are in turn exported downstream [49], resulting in increased aquatic productivity [28] (figures 2(C), (F)). The relatively short snowmelt occurs over several days to weeks and represents ∼35% of export in the Kuparuk River [68]. The significance of the spring snowmelt period has been shown in other Arctic rivers, representing between 20%–70% of annual carbon exports [50, 69, 70]. The spring snowmelt typically generates highly bioavailable DOM in the river network, which reflects the recent origin of the DOM from fresh litter and surficial soil horizons leaching with little previous decomposition [65] or photo-processing on the landscape or in the river [71–73]. Simultaneously, frozen soil restricts the flow of water to organic horizons during snowmelt, introducing dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) into adjacent river networks [74–76]. A portion of the DON may remain on site or be transformed into inorganic forms that can increase nutrient availability for terrestrial plants and soil microorganisms while some of the DON is exported downstream before mineralization to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) [77] (figure 2(C)).\nAs thaw progresses in the Kuparuk, biological activity and deepening water flow paths increasingly control the amount of DOM and nitrogen as DON or DIN reaching the river network and leaving it via downstream export [46] (figure 2(C)). The seasonal thickening of the active layer facilitates the movement of water through deeper mineral soil profiles where it interacts with solute-rich permafrost [16, 74, 78] (figure 2(E)). These deeper flowpaths either promote DOM leaching from detritus and above-ground plant biomass as water builds up at the soil-permafrost interface, or increase rates of decomposition and increase sorption to mineral particles [24, 79]. Newly released DOM and DIN are then exported laterally by surface or subsurface flow paths [53], potentially decreasing soil nutrient availability and altering the chemical composition of waters draining permafrost landscapes [65, 74] (figure 2(C)). As inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) become increasingly limiting as a result of biotic demand, mobilized DOM continues to fuel instream respiration [29, 80, 81]. While low temperatures experienced in the early flow season may limit carbon processing by bacterial respiration, once DOM enters into the stream channel and is moved along the aquatic continuum, it can still experience high rates of processing via photo-mineralization and some partial photo-oxidation as it is transported downstream [71, 72] (figure 2(D)). Photo-oxidation requires sunlight to reach the water column, so its influence on DOM peaks in June and decreases later in the flow season, while hillslope connectivity is still increasing via active layer thickening until late flow season [79] (figure 2(E)). Concurrently, in the late flow season, DON may be sorbed to sediment particles or mineralized to DIN, resulting in increasing lateral flux of inorganic forms of nitrogen, such as NO3− [16, 75, 77]. While late-season DOM often exhibits low bioavailability [82], the decline of photo-processing and influx in DIN may result in a brief increase of late-season heterotrophic response [77] (figure 2(G)).	1.1	2	What we know: seasonality of biogeochemical budgets in the Kuparuk headwaters	1	3	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	241	395	1	1	2

386	\N	N/A	N/A	The period November - April, the dormant vegetation season, produces 82 percent of the annual streamflow. A similar relationship was found on the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia (Reinhart et al. 1963). The relatively shallow soils do not have a large water storage capacity, and recharge occurs quickly. This lack of soil water storage space produces 'flashy' or rapid streamflow response on these watersheds. This minimal soil water storage dictates that baseflow cannot be sustained during prolonged dry periods and the streams cease flow for brief periods during the year. Low flows occur primarily in July and August, periods of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration demand. The longest period without flow was an 11 day span in late August and early September, 1975. \nA flow duration curve (figure 3), representing the 1972 - 1976 period, indicates the distribution of flows and further substantiates the flashy nature of streamflow from the area. Morisawa (1968) indicates that flow duration curves allow characterization of runoff from watersheds. Those watersheds with deep permeable soils and large water storage capacity will exhibit flat flow duration curves, whereas watersheds with little or no storage have steeply sloped curves. The curve from Falling Rock watershed has a relatively steep slope, further evidence of lack of moisture storage within the soils of Robin­son Forest.. \nStormflows \nStormflow or direct runoff from relatively undisturbed forested water­sheds consists primarily of subsurface flow, with little or no surface runoff in evidence. […] July is the only month when quickflow was less than 30 percent of the mean monthly flow. During the study, quickflow averaged 44 percent of the mean annual runoff. If we assume that our streamflow measurements represent total water yield from the watershed, this 44 percent response is very high! Hewlett: and Hibhett. {1967), surveying forested watersheds in the eastern and southeastern U ;S., found very few watersheds with quickflow responses as high as Falling Rock	N/A	13	Results and Discussion	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	65	386	1	2	2

324	\N	N/A	N/A	The increase in δ18O over the late melt seasons and following months in each of the two study years was not strongly influenced by rainfall inputs into the snowpack, and the slope of the increase did not change significantly when snowmelt finished and the basin was free of snow. This pattern, and the very small sub-daily fluctuations in the isotopic signal during the accumulation, melt, and post-melt phases suggest a long transit time in the catchment for water inputs from snowmelt and precipitation. This is somewhat surprising, given the small size of the catchment and its impermeable granitic lithology and large areas of rocky outcrops. It is likely that Peñalara Lake, which drains 34 % of the catchment surface area and has a mean turnover time of 9 days (Toro et al., 2006), plays a role in mixing water inputs over several days, and so buffers some of the potential daily and sub-daily variability in water inputs (Leach and Laudon, 2019). However, this is not a sufficient explanation of the steady evolution of isotope enrichment and the absence of sub-daily fluctuations. The most plausible explanation is groundwater storage in coarse sediments (e.g., talus and moraines) that act as alpine aquifers (Hayashi, 2020, Tague and Grant, 2009). These types of deposits are abundant in the catchment and have an important role in the underground hydrology (Yélamos et al., 2019). The importance of the groundwater storage must explain that single isotope inputs are not quickly transferred to stream response.\nAlthough the runoff has a relatively direct response to water inputs (showing sub-daily cycles), in particular during snowmelt period in snow dominated catchments (Krogh et al., 2022), the absence of variability in the isotope composition suggests that alpine aquifers acted as an intermediate reservoir. The Peñalara Massif has greater subsurface drainage than the surrounding mountains, where most of the streams are dry or have very low baseflow during the warmest and driest period, suggesting the importance of groundwater contributions (Yélamos et al., 2019). Thus, as has been hypothesized for river basins of Svalbard (Blaen et al., 2014), we assume that daily melt water or rainfall infiltrates into alpine aquifers and displaces the previously stored water (piston flow), rather than following a direct meltwater or rainfall runoff scheme (Yang et al., 2012). A similar process has been observed in other alpine areas dominated by snowmelt (Balestra et al., 2022, Woelber et al., 2018).	5	8	Discussion	1	2	N	N	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	173	324	1	1	2

342	\N	N/A	N/A	This study demonstrated that large daily rainfall up to 250 mm (a typical rainfall amount during tropical storm passages; Zhang et al., 2017) and sustained saturation within riparian areas (Figures 2a and 5) led to rapid allochthonous DOC transport to the stream network (Figure 4b). Quebrada Grande, as other humid tropical headwater catchments, was characterized by a fast runoff response (also known as wave celerity; McDonnell & Beven, 2014), which turns in, prompt solute transport (~1.25 hr; Figure 2d), reaching a DOC maximum near 8 mg C/L (Figure 4c). \nThis flushing hypothesis (Mei et al., 2014) explains the first-order mechanism of DOC transport at Quebrada Grande. Organic solutes are leached from near-surface horizons by a rising water table (~80-cm depth) followed by a rapid lateral transport of these materials to the stream via saturation excess runoff in the riparian areas, soils saturated throughout the catchment, and shallow groundwater discharge similar to another forested and steep mountainous catchment in northern Costa Rica as described by Dehaspe et al. (2018). […]\nDifferent DOC sources are often combined near the stream channel within a dynamic saturation area (CDB in Figure 1a), whereby a rapid rising water table intersects DOC-rich soil horizons (Table 2; up to 41.3% in organic matter content) similar to extratropical catchments as for example in the UK uplands (Birkel et al., 2014). The latter explained the high DOC concentrations measured during large storm events (Figure 4). DOC during baseflow exhibited large variations as a result of a potential low biogeochemical attenuation since water logging sustained soil temperature nearly constant at 16°C (Figure 3d). In addition, deep seepage to the bedrock may result in low DOC concentrations in regional groundwater flow within these humid and dynamic ecosystems (Osburn et al., 2018).

360	\N	N/A	N/A	Stream discharge partitioned into stormflow and baseflow shows how groundwater dominates the total flow of Augusta Creek; baseflow averaged 78% of the total discharge (Figure 3b). There is no linear trend in total (p = .14), stormflow (p = .91), or baseflow (p = .83) discharge over the 50 years. In this catchment, stormflow likely reflects mainly precipitation falling on lakes and wetlands that are contiguous with the stream channels because upland soils are highly permeable and there are few impervious surfaces and little overland runoff from uplands to the streams. This is supported by the comparison of annual stormflow volumes to the annual precipitation falling on contiguous lakes and wetlands: on average, stormflow amounts to 57% (range, 44–73%) of the precipitation with no linear trend over the 50 years (p = .09, data not shown). The balance, which equates to a mean of 408 mm year−1, could largely be explained by evapotranspirative losses from the lakes and wetlands. If stormflow originating as overland flow from the uplands were important, the total stormflow volume would exceed the precipitation on lakes and wetlands.\nOur annual water balances for Augusta Creek resemble earlier estimates calculated by Rheaume (1990) over three representative years (1971, 1977, and 1985), which indicated that 62%, 65%, and 59%, respectively, of the annual precipitation was returned to the atmosphere as ET, mainly during the growing season (May–September), although those estimates included ET from contiguous lakes and wetlands as well as uplands. That study also employed hydrograph separation to estimate that about 75% of the annual stream flow in those years was supported by groundwater discharge; our estimate of mean baseflow contribution over the 50-year period is 78%.	3.2	659	Catchment hydrology	1	1	N	Soil hydraulic properties described	N	N	N	N	N	13	360	1	2	2

339	\N	N/A	N/A	Study site\nDuring the period of monitoring, only negligible base-flow has been observed. This feature leads the river discharges to cease few hours after the rainfall event is over. In fact, neither geophysical surveys nor on-site trenches (up to 3 m deep) were able to reach the water-table level in the meta-sedimentary region of AEB, leading to the assumption of hydraulic disconnection between surface and groundwater flow (Costa et al., 2013).\nRainfall and runoff at the AEB\nThe increasing runoff coefficient on the downstream direction (i) follows an increase on the average annual rainfall (490, 570 and 650 mm from 2005 to 2014 in the AEB, Malhada and Iguatu catchments, respectively); (ii) follows an increase on the vegetation degradation; and (iii) may also indicate that the water infiltrated on the headwaters return as surface flow. […]\nAmong the main reasons for the low runoff coefficient at AEB, there are high potential evapotranspiration rates (fivefold the precipitation annually), high infiltration rates associated with deep water table and vegetation interception. In fact, Medeiros et al. (2009), studying the Caatinga in the AEB in the period 2004–2008, concluded that 12% of the rainfall (26 times the runoff) consisted of forest interception losses, caused mainly by the high evaporation rate, despite the vegetation low canopy-trunk storage capacity (0.58 mm). For the events with precipitation above 10 mm, interception losses account for 11% on average, with coefficient of variation of 0.7. During the wet period, monthly interception losses range from 2 to 20 mm in May and February, respectively, whereas in the dry season total rainfall is negligible.\nRunoff under different geological constraints\nThe results have shown different hydrological responses for sub-catchments under distinct geological constraints. For the prevailing sedimentary sub-catchment (SSC, 9 km2, with gauging station EF1 in its outlet, Figure 1), infiltration is a key variable because of the existing deep permeable alluvium. For the prevailing crystalline sub-catchment (CSC, 2 km2, whose outlet is controlled by gauging station EF2, Figure 1), soils have a lateritic impediment layer at the depth of 1 m – 2 m.

Brown indicates the soil matrix, the white box a preferential flow path, gray a tile drain, and light blue groundwater. Red indicates soil water and dark blue event water. A soil moisture threshold in the shallow subsurface must be met prior to significant transport to greater depths. Initially, water infiltrates the soil matrix and macropores at the beginning of the event, and a small amount of event water reaches the tile drain via preferential flow paths. Once the soil moisture threshold is reached, soil matrix water is mobilized and enters preferential flow paths. If a groundwater deficit is present, below-tile storage must be filled to raise the water table to the elevation of the tile to generate significant runoff. Counterclockwise nitrate c-Q hysteresis, observed during large events with little/no antecedent tile flow, reflects a shift from dilute event water in early runoff to nitrate-laden pre-event water after a soil moisture threshold is exceeded.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	1	3	Cropland described	N	N	N	N	N	N	101	6	1	5	1

138	\N	N/A	N/A	The FrEF is located in the Rocky Mountain cordillera of Colorado (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of subalpine watersheds over a large portion of the central Rockies. It spans the subalpine to alpine zone; a zone that is characterized by relatively low temperatures and moderate precipitation (Love, 1960). The area is dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir on higher-elevation and shaded slopes, lodgepole pine on lower-elevation sunny slopes and alpine tundra above the treeline. The 803 ha ESL watershed has received no significant treatment in over 90 years (Retzer, 1962). Precipitation is dominated heavily by snowfall (about 75%) from October through May (Alexander et al., 1985) and runoff is dominated by snowmelt (about 90%) from May through August (Fig. 14.2). Significant summertime convective rainfall events may also temporarily increase flow. The main stem is perennial but baseflow is low, stable and unmeasured during the winter months due to logistical difficulties of stream measurements in winter. The runoff coefficient for annual flow is about 45% with significant wintertime sublimation losses from the canopy and summertime evapotranspiration. Summertime rainfall is primarily used on site by vegetation, with high evaporative losses due to dry air masses and wind. High-elevation stream reaches are intermittent with spring and summertime flows fed by snowmelt (Fig. 14.2). The hydrological regime is dominated by a typical seasonal snowmelt hydrograph with a rapid rising limb in May and June, followed by a long recession, returning to baseflow (second largest Q90/Q50 , Table 14.2) in August (Alexander et al., 1985; Troendle and King, 1985). Extensive spring networks feed the drainage systems as the annual snowmelt pulse moves through the basin (Retzer, 1962). Rainfall events punctuate the snowmelt hydrograph, but contribute insignificant amounts to the annual runoff. Infiltration-excess overland flow is rare, but may occur under the snowpack during the melt season when frozen ground impedes infiltration. Saturation-excess overland flow is extremely rare as infiltration rates for the porous soils and glacial till typically exceed maximum rainfall and snowmelt rates (Retzer, 1962). The ESL represents the highest elevation range, largest snowpack and largest watershed of this cross-site comparison. Maximum snowmelt rates are limited by incoming energy and can never reach extreme rainfall rates. Rain-on-snow flood events can alter flow statistics, but are rare in this portion of the Rockies. The relatively large size of the basin also reduces flashy response or high runoff per unit area observed in smaller basins.	14.2.5	228	Fraser Experimental Forest (FrEF), reference watershed East St Louis (ESL), Colorado	2	3	Vegetation described	Soil described	N	N	N	N	N	72	143	2	1	2

Red cross corresponds to the hyperalkaline system. (b) Enlargement of yellow dashed-square area over Quebrada Danta subcatchment; mean basin slope is ∼33%. Vegetation is scarce on hillslopes; but mostly concentrated in the riparian zones of the floodplain. (c) A conceptual hyperalkaline base flow process coupled with measured water chemistry and field observations. Soil profile is relatively absent (less than 20 cm). Infiltration occurs directly through the ultramafic formation (1). Piston-type flow may occur within serpertinized fractured macropores (i.e., faults) producing freshwater springs if the system is open in respect to CO2 (2). These flow paths appear to be relatively shallow. Deep groundwater flow feeds the creek during the dry season (4). Base flow discharge is a function of storage, where a corresponds to the characteristic recession time scale (presumably low due to high evapotranspiration). Hydraulic parameters such as conductivity (K), drainage porosity (f), and aquifer thickness (D) are unknown. If the system responds as a linear reservoir, then b = 1. Deep groundwater flow may dilute the signature of active serpentinizing (3). However, active serpentinizing flow paths could also emerge as hyperalkaline springs probably with an exponential-piston flow distribution due to the constant structural changes (6). Hyperalkaline fluids form riparian pools coated by a CaCO3 supernatant film where travertine terraces are evident and potential heterotrophic microbial methanogenesis may also occur (7 and 8). The hyperalkaline fluids are characterized by high pH, Ca, and low Mg. The fluids mix with receiving stream waters at low rates and volumes, thus, dilution occurs rapidly (9). As measured in the Río Murciélago watershed methane emanations (24.3% v/v) occur at the streambed (5). Other hydrocarbons may be produced during the serpentinization process. Based on the Mulligan and Burke [2005] regional hydrological model (90 m resolution), recharge could be approximately 18% of the water budget whereas runoff could reach up to 21% during the wet season and evapotranspiration is roughly 60%. Shallow storage could be as lower as 3%.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	1	1	Vegetation described	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	203	108	1	2	1

A large contributing upland area (4–12 times the size of the bofedal) supplies groundwater to the bofedal. The bofedal is composed of layers of peat, clay and saprolite/glaciofluvial sediments. In the fill-up period, rain recharges groundwater and drives flow to bofedales, filling layers of clay and high porosity peat. Runoff in streams is small. Once the bofedal saturates, catchment wide storage capacity is filled, and successive storms generate a steady-state response generating large streamflow. In the release phase, the absence of precipitation leads to decreased groundwater contributions to bofedales and they drain slowly through low conductivity basal layers, sustaining dry season baseflow.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	1	3	Vegetation icons	Soil types described	N	N	N	N	N	243	359	1	5	1

Suction cups (SC) and wick samplers (WS) were installed for soil water monitoring and two wells were implemented for water sampling in wetlands (WE) along the hillslopes covered by tussock grass and cushion plants. The arrows represent the relative importance of various water flow paths as depicted by the stable isotopic composition and inverse transit time proxies (ITTPs shown as blue circles) of soil water at the upper (UP), upper replica (UR), middle (MI), and lower (LO) parts of the hillslope, wetlands (WE), and stream water (Q). The green arrows show the dominance of vertical flow in the volcanic soil layers in the hillslope positions. The yellow arrows refer to deeper subsurface flows being the main contributors of water to streamflow, and include water flow in buried soil horizons and ash layers, wetlands, and fractures on permeable parent material. The small red arrows point to the fact that surface water flow is negligible in the study catchment. For illustrative purposes, the thickness of the upper soil horizons is not to scale and remains constant along slopes. We refer the reader to Tables 1 and 2 for the exact thickness of the soil horizons. Variations in soil thickness and physicochemical properties have been reported from soil mapping (Erauw, 2019). Due to the complex heterogeneity in the distribution of soil horizons, ash layers, volcanoclastic materials, and lava flows at the transition between toeslope and wetland positions, these soils are not shown in the conceptual diagram (marked with a question mark) since they do not affect the interpretation of the main findings.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	2	1	Vegetation types described	Horizons described	N	Slopes described	N	Unknown items identified	N	107	123	8	2	1

134	\N	N/A	N/A	The CPCRW is located near Chatanika in interior Alaska (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the northern boreal forest. The 520 ha C2 reference watershed is isolated and free of any human intervention. The vegetation in CPCRW is dominated by birch and aspen on the south-facing slopes and black spruce forests on the north-facing slopes. The climate is typically continental with warm summers and cold winters. The CPCRW is unique among the watersheds in this cross-site comparison because it is underlain by discontinuous permafrost. The permafrost distribution within the watershed exerts a strong influence over hydrological patterns (Jones and Rinehart, 2010). Studies show that as the areal extent of permafrost increases, peak discharge increases, baseflow decreases and response to precipitation events increases (Bolton et al., 2004). The C2 watershed was chosen as a reference watershed because it is underlain by only about 3% permafrost compared with the adjacent C3 and C4 watersheds which are underlain by 53% and 19%, respectively.\nTotal mean precipitation in the C2 watershed is 412 mm, with mean snowfall and rainfall being 130 mm and 280 mm, respectively (Bolton et al., 2004). Annual maximum snow depth averages 750 mm with a snow water equivalent of 110 mm. Of the total precipitation, nearly 20% becomes streamflow while evapotranspiration makes up over 75% (Bolton et al., 2004). About 35% of the total precipitation falls as snow between October and April. Snowfall peaks around January while rainfall peaks around July. The spatial distribution of rainfall amount is influenced by elevation. The relatively flat FDC for the C2 watershed (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2) may be attributed to the relatively well-drained soils that allow infiltration to deeper subsurface reservoirs. Runoff is generated only when the infiltration capacity is met. Streamflow in the watershed is generated by shallow subsurface storm runoff from permafrost-dominated areas, but steady groundwater baseflows with the highest Q90 /Q50 of all the sites (Table 14.2) are produced from permafrost-free areas such as C2. Spring snowmelt is usually the major hydrological event of the year, although the annual peak flow usually occurs during summer rainstorm events, as the highest rainfall intensities are greater than the maximum snowmelt rate on a daily timescale (Kane and Hinzman, 2004). It may be noted from Fig. 14.2 that the mean monthly streamflow of C2 is relatively even over the months of April through October. During winter the gauges are mostly frozen and any flow is hardly recorded, except for relatively warm temperatures. Although rainfall peaks around July, there is an increase in mean flow from July to September due to an increase in baseflow.	14.2.1	225	Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW), reference sub-watershed C2, Alaska	2	3	Vegetation described	Soil described	N	N	N	N	N	32	143	8	1	2
135	\N	N/A	N/A	Located in a coast redwood and Douglas fir forest on the Jackson Demonstration State Forest in north-western California (Fig. 14.1), the CCEW hosts research designed to evaluate the effects of timber management on watershed processes. Initially, the entire 473 ha NF watershed served as the reference watershed, but after portions were logged in 1985, three NF sub-watersheds (16 to 39 ha) were designated as long-term reference watersheds. Bedrock is marine sandstone and shale of the Franciscan Complex. Most soils are 1–2 m deep loams and clay-loams and underlain by saprolite at depths of 3–8 m near ridgetops. Only about one-fifth of the 4.6 km/km2 drainage density supports perennial streamflow. Timber production has been the major land use, and evidence of 19th century logging and the impacts of this legacy persist. Snow is hydrologically insignificant and 95% of rainfall occurs in October–April. Fog occurs on about one-third of days in June–September, reducing summer transpiration (Keppeler, 2007). The marine influence ensures that summer air temperatures rarely exceed 20°C and winter minimums seldom drop below 0°C. Stream runoff is about half of the average annual rainfall (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Transpiration and canopy evaporation account for nearly equal portions of the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Actual evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture deficits in May–September. Analysis of climate-related trends suggests that autumn rainfall and streamflow have declined, but with no change in annual totals. The FDC for CCEW spans a wide range of streamflow compared with most of the other USDA-EFR sites (Plates 11 and 12) due to the strong seasonal pattern of large, episodic winter rain events that typically produce multiple, short-duration peak flows while extended summer droughts result in a long, slow recession for about half the year (Fig. 14.2). Summer streamflow is generated primarily from groundwater, and by autumn about 300 mm of precipitation is needed to mitigate moisture deficits sufficiently to generate stormflow. Stormflow (total flow based on difference between initial discharge at start of runoff and the discharge at 3 days following the cessation of the rainfall event) comprises about two-thirds of annual runoff (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Infiltration is rapid on uncompacted soils and vertical throughflow dominates near the surface. A deeper clay-rich argillic horizon can impede downward flow and generate lateral subsurface flow, although preferential flow through interconnected soil macropores limits pore-pressure increases and the extent of this perched flow. Perennial and intermittent soil pipes occur in the upper 2 m of the regolith and are frequently encountered near channel heads. When transient groundwater tables rise to the elevation of these pipes, they rapidly transmit subsurface flow to channels, mitigating pore-pressure increases upslope (Keppeler and Brown, 1998). Saturation-excess overland (return) flow is limited, but can occur on valley bottoms during large storms.	14.2.2	227	Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW), reference watershed North Fork (NF), California	1	2	Vegetation described	Soil described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	35	143	1	1	2
136	\N	N/A	N/A	The CHL is located in western North Carolina (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of southern Appalachian mixed deciduous hardwoods. The 13 ha WS18 watershed was last selectively harvested in the early 1920s prior to the establishment of the CHL (Douglass and Hoover, 1988). Although the watershed has not been actively managed for more than 80 years, there have been several natural disturbances that have altered forest structure and species composition, including Chestnut blight fungus (Endothia parasitica) in the 1920s–1930s, drought in the 1980s and 2000s, Hurricane Opal in 1995, and hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) defoliation from 2002 to the present (Boring et al., 2014). Precipitation in WS18 averages 2010 mm/year; it is highest in the late winter months and lowest in the autumn, although a disproportionate amount of large events associated with tropical storms occurs during this season. Less than 10% of precipitation occurs as snow. The variability in precipitation has been increasing over time resulting in more frequent extremely wet years and extremely dry years, while annual average air temperature has been increasing by 0.5°C/decade since 1981 (Laseter et al., 2012). Annual precipitation in WS18 is approximately equally partitioned into streamflow (49.6%) and evapotranspiration (50.4%). During the growing season, transpiration accounts for 55% of total evapotranspiration with evaporation from canopy interception making up the balance, approximately 15% of precipitation (Ford et al., 2011). Streamflow is typically highest in March–April and lowest in September–October but never ceases, even during extreme drought. Seasonal patterns in streamflow reflect the combined effects of the seasonality in precipitation and evapotranspiration (Fig. 14.2). Baseflows are relatively high, producing the third largest Q90/Q50 ratio among sites (Table 14.2). Baseflows are sustained by lateral movement of water through deep unsaturated soil (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume), driven by large hydraulic gradients induced by steep slopes (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1963). On average, approximately 5% of annual precipitation (9% of annual streamflow) is discharged as stormflow (Swift et al., 1988). Stormflow originates primarily from small portions of the watershed located adjacent to the stream in coves and in riparian zones where the water table may be near the surface (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967). Shallow lateral subsurface discharge from upslope landscape positions to streams can also contribute to stormflow where large soil macropores exist. Overland flow is extremely rare or non-existent because of the presence of well-developed forest floors and subsurface macropores.	14.2.3	227	Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), reference watershed WS18, North Carolina	1	1	Vegetation described	N	N	Slopes described	N	N	N	47	143	1	2	2
137	\N	N/A	N/A	The FnEF is located in eastern West Virginia (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the ‘unmanaged’ forests of the central Appalachian region. The 39 ha WS4 watershed is forested with an approximately 100-year-old stand of mixed deciduous hardwoods. The bedrock is acidic sandstone and shale. Depth to bedrock is generally less than 1 m and the topography is steep. Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year and averages 1458 mm. Although snow is common in winter, snowpack generally lasts no more than a few weeks; snow contributes approximately 14% on average of precipitation (Adams et al., 1994). Large rainfall events can occur during extra-tropical hurricanes in the summer and autumn, but about half of the largest storms have occurred during the dormant season (1 November–30 April), when streams are most responsive to rainfall because evapotranspiration losses are low (Fig. 14.2). The stream channel is intermittent near the top of the watershed. Streamflow may cease during the late summer and early autumn (about 10% of daily flows), in response to high evapotranspirative demand and low precipitation. Although baseflow contributes relatively little to Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2), it dominates stream discharge in WS4. Most discharge occurs during the dormant season (Fig. 14.2) due to greater precipitation and decreased evapotranspirative demand from deciduous forests. Baseflow is sustained by lateral subsurface flow to channels; DeWalle et al. (1997) characterized the mean transit time for baseflow on WS4 as 1.4–1.6 years, which suggests a dominance of slow movement through the soil matrix. The water balance on WS4 was well quantified by Patric (1973) with runoff accounting for about 40% of precipitation, 27% of the balance being lost through transpiration and about 16% to canopy evaporation. Seasonal differences in losses from canopy interception due to leaf development and leaf drop were detected. Stormflow discharge is fairly flashy (Plates 11 and 12), with the storm hydrograph responding rapidly to storm precipitation inputs and then returning quickly to baseflow conditions, and streamflow generation occurs via saturation excess flow. Stormflow discharge typically occurs less than 15% of the time. There is little to no infiltration-excess overland flow even during the largest storms because of the high infiltration capacity of an intact forest floor.	14.2.4	228	Fernow Experimental Forest (FnEF), reference watershed WS4, West Virginia	1	3	Vegetation described	Soil described	Geological types described	Slopes described	N	N	N	66	143	1	1	2
228	\N	N/A	N/A	Our experimental study on moraine chronosequences in two proglacial areas in the Central Swiss Alps shows that despite the increase in vegetation cover, root density, and soil organic matter content, the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with moraine age due to the decrease in gravel and increase in silt and clay content. However, this did not affect the effective infiltration rates during the sprinkling experiments, which was high for all moraines and increased with rainfall intensity.\nThe peak OF ratios increased with moraine age and were largest for the oldest moraines on silicate bedrock, where OF was driven by flow along the dense root network and saturation-excess due to ponding above a lower permeability clay-rich layer at 20–40 cm below the soil surface. In the calcareous glacier forefield, however, OF did not occur on the old moraines during the intense sprinkling experiments, presumably because the clay-rich layers were less pronounced and the sprinkling experiments were too small to cause saturation. During larger (but lower intensity) natural rainfall events that exceeded the storage threshold, OF was observed for these moraines. OF occurred most frequently on the young moraines and was likely caused by saturation of the soil above stones and rocks that were buried near the surface, even-though the infiltration rate in the sediment between the stones was very high. The larger water storage in the soils of the older moraines, due to the higher water retention caused by the larger silt-, clay-, and organic matter content, resulted in more mixing of rainfall and soil water and a larger contribution of pre-event water to OF than for the younger moraines. The higher soil aggregate stability and vegetation cover—rather than differences in the OF volume or flow rates—caused the sediment fluxes to be lower for the old moraines than the young moraines.\nThese results, in combination with the changes in SSF (Maier et al., 2021), help us to understand how hillslope characteristics and runoff generation processes change during the first millennia of soil development and the interactions between these processes (cf. Figure 1). This is important for understanding the spatial and temporal changes in runoff generation in rapidly changing Alpine areas and can be used to inform landscape evolution models.	6	24	Conclusions	2	1	Vegetation described	Multiple properties described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	223	228	2	2	2
229	\N	N/A	N/A	The weak damping effect of the isotope ratios in streamflow compared to rainfall (Table 3; Figure S4) indicated a rapid runoff generation with limited isotope mixing in soils and groundwater, similar and even more pronounced than for other catchments in Costa Rica (Birkel et al., 2021). [...] Nonetheless, the TAM identified quickly draining water from the upper soil water storage at the hillslopes directly into the saturated riparian zone (Sánchez-Murillo, Romero-Esquivel, et al., 2019). From there, mostly unmixed water (Figure 6f,g with low mixing volume parameters MV) rapidly contributes to streamflow, as reflected by high values (Figure 6a,e) of the linear rate coefficients a (Flow from hillslope to riparian area; Table 2) and the non-linear parameter α (flow from riparian area to stream; Table 2). The most likely runoff generation mechanism is saturation excess overland flow and near-surface stormflow. In fact, field observations during sampling campaigns confirmed the prevalence of swamp areas near the riparian zones. Hortonian overland flow can be excluded due to the measured high infiltration capacities of the humic top soil layer that exceed the highest observed rainfall intensities in contrast to other small-scale catchments in Latin America (Chaves et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2012). [...] The comparison of different calibration periods and storage parameters showed that only the upper hillslope has a larger mixing volume (Figure 6f), but that water passes too fast likely via preferential flow pathways to noticeably dampen the isotope output variability. [...] In our case, however, the hydrograph separation (Figure 8) indicated a constant but small contribution of water from a deeper substrate to the perennial stream (average BFI of 37% ± 22%; Figure 7b). The water balance showed a loss of water from our system (Table 4) indicating that a fraction of vertical water fluxes percolates into the highly fractured volcanic bedrock, and thus cannot be measured as streamflow at the catchment outlet. Evidence for re-emerging regional groundwater were found in the floodplains downstream of the study site using age dating tracers (Genereux et al., 2013) and modelling (Osburn et al., 2018; Zanon et al., 2014). [...] The low BFIs support the notion of a saturation excess surface runoff and shallow interflow dominated system (Sánchez-Murillo, Romero-Esquivel, et al., 2019). Interestingly, the BFIs in our study area were also much lower than observed for other catchments in Costa Rica (Birkel et al., 2012; Westerberg & Birkel, 2015) and other tropical catchments (Beck et al., 2013; Peña-Arancibia et al., 2010) which are commonly characterized by high groundwater contributions to total streamflow. Even in other fast responding catchments in Costa Rica, the flashy response in streamflow after storm events is characterized by mixing and dampening effects from available deeper soil and groundwater (Dehaspe et al., 2018). Therefore, our study site is a pristine catchment (Klaus & McDonnell, 2013) in the central American tropics that deviates from the old water paradox (Barthold & Woods, 2015; Sidle et al., 2000), that is, the rapid mobilization of previously stored “old” water via subsurface flow paths during storm events (Muñoz-Villers & McDonnell, 2012), resulting in strongly damped tracer output composition (Kirchner, 2003). Due to the young water dominance, short TTs and low groundwater contribution to streamflow, we, therefore, rejected our previously formulated working hypothesis.	5.1	11	Runoff generation and mixing in a very humid rainforest catchment	6	1	N	Soil types described	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	39	229	2	2	2

234	\N	N/A	N/A	The mean groundwater levels and the groundwater response timing were correlated with topographic indices. This suggests that groundwater levels in depressions and the footslopes are high and respond quickly (Fig. 10b, letter G). The ridge sides respond later and less frequently. [...] The rise of the groundwater level into soil layers close to the soil surface with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity means that lateral, preferential flowpaths are activated and contribute water to the streams with only a short delay (Fig. 10b, letters E-G). Once lateral connectivity is established between the individual groundwater response areas and the channel network\n(Fig. 10b, number VII), the midslope areas also contribute to streamflow. [...] During these smaller events, the initial rise in streamflow is maybe not only generated by fast lateral flow from the hillslopes but the wetlands close to the streams also become more connected during events and also contribute pre-event water to streamflow [...] shallow subsurface flow from the near stream areas likely occurs throughout the year but that the midslope and ridge sites only become active and connected during larger events. Overall, these results suggest that the contributing areas  expand during rainfall events and that different areas of the catchment become connected and contribute to streamflow at different times. Groundwater will mainly deliver pre-event water to the stream but the preferential flow pathways in the near surface layers may deliver a mixture of event and pre-event water. T: Dye tracer tests in the Vogelbach catchment by Weiler et al. (1999) showed that preferential flow can be a source of event water. I think that these shallow pathways may get flushed during large events. H: Surface runoff also contributes some of the event water to the stream, although its isotopic composition and chemistry suggest that it is a mixture of event and pre-event water (Sauter, 2017). Saturation overland flow from the meadows and wetlands is important during rainfall events. Infiltration excess overland flow occurs on the bare areas but likely infiltrates when it reaches the vegetated areas. So there are multiple runoff processes happening at the same time	6	444	Discussion on the main runoff generation processes in the Alptal catchments	5	3	Wetland described	N	N	N	N	N	N	8	234	2	6	2

363	\N	N/A	N/A	Canopy interception, throughfall, stemflow, surface runoff, and water table level were assessed from ground measurements at the field scale between 2011 and 2014 at the IAB site. We conclude that canopy interception may range from 4 to 20 % of gross precipitation in the cerrado and that stemflow values are around 1 % of gross precipitation. Our results also indicate that the average runoff coefficient was less than 1 % in the plots under undisturbed cerrado and that the deforestation has the potential to increase up to 20-fold the runoff coefficient value. In addition, we did not find evidence of net groundwater table changes, possibly because the water table is at a significant depth at the IAB site, the deep rooting depth of the trees, and the study period with less rainfall than the historical mean. As only little excess water runs off (either as surface water or groundwater), the water storage may be estimated by the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. 	4	N/A	Conclusions	1	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	103	363	1	2	2
237	\N	N/A	N/A	This study highlighted the effects of preferential flow in frozen soils and infiltration–refreezing mechanisms on the hydrologic functioning and winter water balance of prairie grasslands. Despite the ground remaining frozen throughout snowmelt events, infiltration into frozen soil was the major sink of snowmelt at all three sites, and this modulated the amount of runoff available for depression-focused recharge. In addition, focused infiltration and preferential flow in frozen soil enabled meltwater to bypass a portion of the soil profile and groundwater recharge prior to ground thaw. Field data suggested that the refreezing of infiltrated meltwater during midwinter snowmelt enhanced runoff generation in frozen grassland soils, highlighting the feedback effect of previous melt events on later snowmelt event partitioning. Time delays between snow cover depletion and ponding in depressions demonstrated that shallow subsurface flow, in addition to overland flow, can be an important runoff mechanism on frozen prairie hillslopes. Both of these flow paths may facilitate preferential mass transport to groundwater.	6	N/A	Conclusion	1	2	Grassland described	N	N	N	N	N	N	233	237	1	1	2

260	\N	N/A	N/A	Measurements of rainfall, stemflow, and throughfall at Caspar Creek indicate that approximately 22.4% of the rainfall in this 120-year-old redwood forest is stored by foliage and bark and evaporates before it reaches the litter layer. More than half of the water contributing to total interception loss is intercepted after the initial wet-up period during a storm, either to evaporate during the storm or to be held in storage for evaporation after the storm. Because leaf-area indices are relatively high in coniferous forests, the surface area of wetted foliage is large during storms, so low evaporation rates (per unit area of water surface) can lead to large volumes of water evaporated (per unit area of ground surface). Nevertheless, interception rates observed during periods of intense rainfall appear to be too high to be explained by in rain evaporation alone, even if all foliage surfaces are wetted. An additional component of in-rain interception might be accounted for by absorption by bark. Because the water storage capacity in bark is quite large in the Caspar Creek forest, the amount of rainfall absorbed by bark during most storms is expected to be roughly proportional to the amount of rain encountering the bark. The volume of water sequestered per unit time would thus increase with rainfall intensity, while the proportion of rainfall intercepted would remain relatively constant, as observed. Comparison of the timing of throughfall relative to rainfall in a nearby clearing indicates that the volume of water in storage in the canopy varies with rainfall intensity. Static storage in foliage is estimated to be about 1 mm, while the dynamic component of foliar storage can be as high as 2.4 mm. During periods of high-intensity rain, total foliar storage is therefore expected to exceed 3 mm. Water balance calculations suggest that interception loss accounted for about half the annual evapotranspiration in the North Fork Caspar Creek watershed when it supported a 120-year-old redwood forest (Table 4). About 68% of the annual evapotranspiration occurs during the October–April wet season, and during this time interception accounts for about two-thirds of the loss.

273	\N	N/A	N/A	Previous work has shown that the hydrological response of the Bruntland Burn is strongly dependent on the connectivity between the steeper podzols and peats in the riparian wetland [Birkel et al., 2014]. The extent of saturation in the riparian wetland expands and contracts in response to antecedent wetness and event precipitation [similar to Dunne et al., 1975]. In wet periods, the saturation zone was observed to extend to 40% of the catchment area and the connectivity between the hillslopes and wetland is strong as a result of lateral flow [Ali et al., 2014]. This drives the main storm period response of the catchment, with runoff being generated by saturation overland flow from this expanding saturation zone which is fed by seepage from upslope [Tetzlaff et al., 2014]. In drier periods, the saturation zone can be as low as 2% of the catchment and the hillslopes can become disconnected. At these times, streamflow is sustained mainly from groundwater in the drift [Soulsby et al., 1998; Blumstock et al., 2015]. However, precipitation events following dry antecedent periods mainly generate runoff from the saturated area. At such times, precipitation on the drier hillslopes simply replenishes soil moisture deficits [Tetzlaff et al., 2014; Geris et al., 2015].	2	7760	Study Site	2	2	N	Soil types described	N	N	N	N	N	25	273	2	5	2
274	\N	N/A	N/A	Within this model, the three major subdivisions of land cover in this landscape are considered: exposed Precambrian bedrock, soil-filled areas covered with wetland or forest vegetation underlain by permafrost, and open water in ponds, lakes, and connecting streams. The spring freshet is a predominant feature of this hydrological regime (Figure 10a). During this time, contributing areas can be large with significant portions of the basin hydrologically connected to the outlet. This can be dampened when dry conditions during the previous freezeup leave large storage deficits relative to snowmelt inputs in soil-filled areas and lakes. Runoff from exposed bedrock carries solutes into downslope soil filled areas where it is augmented by local runoff generation and additional solute load. The frost table at this time of year is shallow, so runoff pathways tend to be in shallow soil depths where DOC can be transported downslope. Inorganic nitrogen sources are available because most vegetation is dormant until after the freshet when the soils thaw and the growing season begins. The remainder of the summer is typically characterized by evapotranspiration rates that exceed rainfall, such that the water table elevation drops in concert with the frost table, and large storage deficits develop in lakes and soil-filled components of the landscape (Figure 10b). Runoff from exposed bedrock carrying solutes is intercepted in the soil-filled areas and goes into storage. During the typically dry summer conditions, soil-filled areas are hydrologically disconnected from the stream and do not contribute runoff, suppressing chemical transport (e.g., late summer 2012/2013). There can be some subsurface transport of water, solids, and carbon, but inorganic nitrogen tends to be efficiently used by the vegetation with little left for transport downstream. Lake levels decline from the low headwater runoff, reducing streamflow. [...] However, when autumn rainfall is sufficient, lateral flows from bedrock can cause water tables to rise and overcome storage deficits in soil-filled areas. The interaction of subsurface flow with deeper mineral soils at the base of the thick active layer may increase solute loads. Saturation of soils also maintains the water table near the topographic surface so that the majority of water flux is through high hydraulic conductivity zones of organic-rich soils, which augments the carbon flux. Inorganic nitrogen loading begins to increase in the fall as vegetation goes into senescence. During a typical recession, the conditions illustrated in Figure 10b likely continue right into the period when freezeback begins. A comparison of Figures 10b–10d highlights the differences the model suggests exist in water, carbon, solute, and nitrogen fluxes that occur during a period of enhanced winter streamflow. By midwinter during the periods of enhanced winter streamflow, the freezeback of soils has been completed, isolating most terrestrial areas from the lake-stream network. High autumn rainfall-runoff results in a high level of storage in the lakes and an ample volume of water available to provide steady streamflow through the winter. 	6	123	Conceptual Model of Chemistry During Winter	3	3	Seasonal change discussed	N	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	15	274	6	1	2

A few areas consist of carbonates that have a tendency to karstify, but no fast runoff reaction related to these processes has been observed. The hillslopes are very steep resulting in a high relief energy. The hydrogeologic runoff process map of the catchment is shown in Figure 2a. Large parts of the catchment are characterised by shallow interflow processes. These areas, especially in the upper part of the hillslopes, may get saturated and form surface runoff. The scree areas in the lower parts of the hillslopes have rather large depth and are dominated by deeper interflow processes which may buffer some of the fast surface runoff generated in the upper parts.

There is, however, a potential for runoff retention during strong precipitation events on areas dominated by deep groundwater flow and interflow of different origins. Both in the Karnic Alps as well as in the Gail crystalline deep creeping areas occur (dark green areas) that are characterised by deep groundwater flow (Figure 3a). Scree areas in the lower parts of the hillslopes and valley deposits in the shallower valleys of the Karnic Alps are dominated by deeper interflow. The dolomites in the Lienzer dolomites are strongly weathered forming additional scree areas with deep interflow in the valley bottoms. Runoff retention of the tributaries from the southern and northern valleys may also occur on the large alluvial cone in the valley bottom. During very wet conditions, the alluvial cone may however get saturated so that tributaries can bypass it.

300	\N	N/A	N/A	Considering the entire RVC and its nested spatial organization, snowmelt, shallow groundwater and soil water were found to be the main contributors to stream runoff and spring recharge, but with different relative importance in the different parts of the catchment. Soil water and shallow groundwater are the dominant end-members in the soil-mantled subcatchments whereas rainfall and snowmelt play a more direct role on stream runoff and spring water in the upper part of RVC, characterized by rocky areas. A weak hydrochemical interaction between water input (rainfall and snowmelt) and soil and rocks, and little and relatively fast subsurface runoff exist in the rocky subcatchments  of  RVC,  characterized  by  waters  with  low  EC  and  highly  variable isotopic composition. Conversely, rainfall and snowmelt are likely characterized by longer residence times in the lower parts of RVC and in its soil-mantled subcatchments, and  represent  important  sources  for  baseflow  and  shallow  groundwater  recharge. These  findings,  coupled  to  hydrometric  data  and  geological  observations,  suggest the existence of two main water circulation systems at RVC that are hydrologically connected through the principal channel. There is a likely presence of a smaller and faster aquifer in the upper part of the catchment, and a deep and slow subsurface flow component in the lower part, responsible for stronger hydrochemical interactions between shallow subsurface water and soil (Penna et al., 2017). The main processes generating streamflow in the soil-mantled subcatchments of RVC, as BCC, where topography is characterized by steep slopes and a narrow riparian zone, include direct channel precipitation, saturation overland flow from the riparian zone, and shallow subsurface flow from the riparian zone and the hillslopes (Fig. 10). Channel precipitation and saturation overland flow onto saturated riparian areas provide the most important contribution to streamflow during dry conditions. This was revealed by i) the observed decrease of stream EC during the initial parts of rainfall events; ii) the increase of event water fractions in streamflow (as inferred from two-component hydrograph separation based on water isotopes) at approximately the same time of the EC decrease; and iii) the correlation between the magnitude of the EC decrease and the average event water contribution during this first part of the streamflow response (Penna et al., 2016). During dry antecedent moisture conditions, shallow subsurface flow develops mainly in the riparian zone, with no or negligible response of hillslope groundwater. This reflects in small runoff ratios and low stormflow values (Fig. 5), and small fractions of event water in the stream (Fig. 10a). Typically, the riparian zone is only partially saturated during dry conditions but saturated areas expand with increasing wetness conditions. Thus, during wet or very wet antecedent moisture conditions, such as large rainfall events or snowmelt events at the peak melting season, overland flow develops on the entire riparian zone. This reflects in higher contributions of event water to the stream (pie chart in Fig. 10b) compared  to  dry  conditions.  Moreover,  with  increasing  wetness,  shallow  subsurface flow develops in an increasing number of riparian and hillslope locations, as shown by response of piezometers, and above a certain threshold a larger area of the catchment contributes to streamflow, leading to a greater runoff production (Fig. 5).	5	417	Summary of runoff generation processes at RVC and future research	3	2	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	189	300	3	5	2

287	\N	N/A	N/A	A previous study in the SDL catchment using hydrogeochemical end member mixing analysis concluded that ~60% of the annual streamflow is a result of overland or lateral within-snow flow paths and ~10% interflow (Hill, 2017). This has been explained by a combination of frozen ground that inhibits infiltration in the winter and spring (Rey et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2015) and saturation excess overland flow as the deep snow produces snowmelt volumes above the storage capacity of the relatively shallow soils (Hill, 2017). Our observations confirm that high θw interpreted to mean ponding at the snow–soil interface is occurring within the snowpack that is likely producing overland/intra-snowpack flow. Importantly, our observations bring new insight to the catchment-scale distribution of these processes. Rather than elevated θw occurring across a widespread area, our results suggest that regions of very high θw values (i.e. >0.2) are highly localized at the base of a hillslope and shallow snow adjacent to deeper snowdrifts (Figure 6) yet may contribute disproportionately to catchment response (Figure 7). 	4	11	DISCUSSION	2	1	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	195	287	2	2	2

307	\N	N/A	N/A	1. Soil moisture reservoir filling – initially the upper part of the soil is dry, and rainfall is readily absorbed in the unsaturated zone. This leads to an increase in soil moisture content, but a lack of conductivity prevents ground- water levels from rising in conjunction with soil moisture. As a result, the discharge during this phase is hardly sensitive to storage changes up to a storage in- crease of ∼30 mm. \n2. Groundwater response – the unsaturated zone is near saturation and additional rainfall readily leads to saturation of the soil matrix. Under these conditions the specific yield μ is very small (0.06 over a large part of the storage increase in Fig. 11) and groundwater levels can rise rapidly. Since groundwater levels strongly control the field-scale subsurface flow to the network of secondary and tertiary ditches, the discharge is moderately sensitive to changes in total catchment storage. The rapid rise of groundwater levels continues up to a storage increase of ∼120–130 mm, when groundwater levels reach the surface and ponding occurs. \n3. Surface depression filling and surface runoff – when ponding occurs, two mechanisms come into play with contrasting effects on the discharge increase. First, the specific yield strongly increases (since for ponded areas μ = 1), effectively reducing the increase in hydraulic heads in response to rainfall. Secondly, however, when ponds start to connect to the network of ditches, over- land flow becomes an important runoff mechanism and discharge increases rapidly. This is a typical mechanism during flash floods, and the moment at which overland flow is initiated determines for a large part the timing of flash flood response (Marchi et al., 2010). This is also the case in the Hupsel Brook catchment. The slope of the line in Fig. 11a is very steep between total catchment storage of 120 mm and 135 mm. Measured groundwater levels indicate phreatic surfaces extending to above the local height of the land surface (which was confirmed by observations during post-event field surveys). \n4. Backwater feedback – in the fourth phase discharge increases to above the design discharge of the culverts, leading to backwater feedbacks and extensive flooding of fields upstream of the culverts (Fig. 12). Such flooding was observed during post-event field surveys I and II (Fig. 8), especially in the area with elevations below 26 m (Fig. 1).	5	2002	Synthesis of the hydrologic response	1	4	N	N	N	N	N	N	N	98	307	1	5	2

391	\N	N/A	N/A	The local vegetation is typical for the Scottish Highlands: the vegetation on the hillslopes and drier areas is predominantly 30–50 cm high heather shrubs (Calluna vulgaris), while the wetter areas and riparian zone are covered with Sphagnum spp. mosses and grass (Molinia caerulea). Just 11% of the catchment is covered by Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest to be found mostly on steeper hillslopes (Wang et al., 2017). Freely draining peaty podzols prevail on the upper and steeper hillslopes where heather dominates (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). Here, the GW table is often >1 m below the soil surface (Blumstock et al., 2016; Scheliga et al., 2018). The catchment interfluves and steeper hillslopes have been identified as the main areas for GW recharge. On the lower hillslopes and valley bottom, peats and peaty gley soils characterize the subsurface with shallower GW tables close (<0.3 m) to the ground surface (Blumstock et al., 2016). These wet conditions are sustained by subsidy from groundwater discharge on the lower slopes and the saturated peaty soils generate overland flow in storm events.\n\nThe response of the volumetric soil moisture content (VSMC) in the upper hillslope has been shown to have a more distinct drying and rewetting pattern between storm events compared to very conservative responses in the quasi-permanently saturated riparian zone and lower hillslopes (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). The hillslopes can contribute rapid storm run-off once they become hydrologically connected to the stream network, via the wetlands, during prolonged storm events (Soulsby et al., 2015). However, it has been shown that during summer, in particular, soils under forest are substantially drier than those under heather (Geris et al., 2015) due to higher interception and transpiration losses (Kuppel et al., 2020).	2	3	Study Site	4	1	Vegetation types described	Soil described	N	N	N	N	N	25	391	2	2	2
392	\N	N/A	N/A	The Font del Regàs catchment, located in the Montseny Natural Park (outlet at 41°50’ N, 2°28′ E), includes a total drainage area of 15.5 km2 that ranges between 405 and 1603 m a.s.l. (Figure 1). The local climate is sub-humid Mediterranean with mild winters, wet springs, and dry summers. Long-term (1940–2000) average annual air temperature was 12.1 ± 2.5°C (average ± SD), whereas average annual precipitation during this period was 925 ± 151 mm year−1 (Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016). A vegetation gradient follows the altitude gradient in the catchment. Deciduous European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest and a small proportion of heathlands (Calluna vulgaris L. and gramineae) dominate the upper, steeper parts of the catchment (800 to 1600 m a.s.l.), whereas evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) forest dominates in the lower half of the catchment (400 to 1000 m a.s.l.). A well-developed (10–20 m wide) riparian forest, composed of a mixture of tree species including black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and black poplar (Populus nigra L.), is found in near-stream zones in the lower, U-shaped part of the valley (500–750 m a.s.l.; Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016; Poblador et al., 2017). No riparian vegetation exists in the upper, V-shaped part of the catchment. Annual potential evapotranspiration rates depend on the forest type and correspond to 550–650 mm year−1 in the evergreen forest, 600–750 mm year−1 in the deciduous forest, and 750–1000 mm year−1 in the riparian forest (Àvila et al., 1996; Llorens & Domingo, 2007; Lupon et al., 2018). The overall potential evapotranspiration in the catchment as estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation is ca. 750 to 800 mm year−1 (Lupon et al., 2018). Upslope soils are sandy, with a 3–5 cm-deep O horizon followed by a 5–20-cm deep A horizon and a > 100 cm-deep B horizon. Groundwater in the upslopes flows more than 1 m below the soil surface (b.s.s.) and percolates rapidly through the soil towards the stream by preferential flow paths (Àvila et al., 1995). The catchment is drained by a perennial stream that exhibits a persistent flow regime (sensu Botter et al., 2013). The geomorphology of the streambed changes along the stream; at the upper parts of the catchment the streambed is composed by rocks and cobbles and wetted width is ca. 1.5 m, whereas sands and gravels predominate at the valley bottom, where wetted width is ca. 3.5 m. Monitoring of hydrological data at Font del Regàs, including stream discharge and groundwater levels, was previously limited to a few years in the early 2010s (see e.g., Lupon et al., 2018; Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016).\n\nIn our sites, riparian soil moisture averages 40 to 50% at Font del Regàs, whereas it rarely exceeds 20% at Fuirosos (Butturini et al., 2002; Lupon, Sabater, et al., 2016). Moreover, riparian groundwater levels at Font del Regàs remain relatively stable throughout the year, indicating that a permanent saturated aquifer is connected even during summer (Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016). 	2, 5.1	3, 11	Monitoring Sites, Variability in stream responses at Font del Regàs (perennial) and Fuirosos (intermittent)	1	1	Vegetation species described	Soil described	N	N	N	N	N	68	392	1	2	2
393	\N	N/A	N/A	The Fuirosos catchment, located in the Montnegre-Corredor Natural Park (outlet at 41°43’ N, 2°34′ E), includes a total drainage area of 16.5 km2 that ranges between 80 and 758 m a.s.l. (Figure 1). The seasonality of temperature and precipitation at Fuirosos is similar to that of Font del Regàs, but the overall climate is warmer and drier, typically semi-arid Mediterranean due to the high evapotranspiration in relation to the precipitation (Medici et al., 2008). During the period 2009–2019, average annual air temperature was 13.9 ± 0.5°C and average annual precipitation was 658 ± 216 mm year−1, as measured by a nearby meteorological station. Catchment forests are dominated by evergreen species, including cork oak (Quercus suber L.), Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis L.), and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster L.). Small proportions of deciduous forests are present in the upper parts of the catchment and include chestnut (Castanea sativa L.), hazel (Corylus avellana L.), and downy oak (Quercus pubescens L.). Lower parts of the stream channel are embedded in sandy alluvial deposits and flanked by a well-developed riparian zone, which is 10–20 m wide and consists mainly of plane tree (Platanus hispanica L.) and black alder (Bernal et al., 2005). Annual potential evapotranspiration for the overall catchment ranges between 975 and 1418 mm year−1, as estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation for different periods between 1999 and 2006 (Bernal et al., 2012; Medici et al., 2008). Upslope soils are poorly developed, with a thin organic O horizon, or more frequently an Ao horizon that transition into a B horizon at ca. 5 cm depth. Groundwater in the upslopes flows more than 2 m b.s.s. and percolates rapidly through the soil towards the stream by preferential flow paths (Butturini et al., 2003). The catchment is drained by an intermittent stream that exhibits an erratic flow regime (sensu Botter et al., 2013). No surface runoff is observed during the driest months of the year, typically from late June to late September (Bernal et al., 2002). The streambed is dominated by sand, rocks, and boulders and mean wetted width increases along the stream from 1.5 to 2.5 m during the months with observable surface runoff. Stream discharge and groundwater levels were previously monitored during the late 1990s and the 2000s (see Vázquez et al., 2013 and within references).\n\nIn our sites, riparian soil moisture averages 40 to 50% at Font del Regàs, whereas it rarely exceeds 20% at Fuirosos (Butturini et al., 2002; Lupon, Sabater, et al., 2016). [...] In contrast, riparian groundwater levels at Fuirosos experience large seasonal fluctuations and can drop down in the summer and remain disconnected from the stream for months (Butturini et al., 2003). Similar to other semi-arid catchments, previous modelling exercises identified two main groundwater storages at Fuirosos; (i) a perched, riparian shallow aquifer that has the potential to transfer water to the stream during the non-dry season, and (ii) a permanent, saturated deep aquifer located well below the streambed that is generally disconnected from the shallow aquifer and from the stream (Medici et al., 2008). These two groundwater storages are connected only during the wettest conditions. [...] The flow regime at Fuirosos consistently includes a full season without surface runoff and a characteristic non-linear hydrological behaviour during the transitions between wet and dry conditions (Medici et al., 2008). 	2, 5.2	3, 11	Monitoring Sites, Variability in stream responses at Font del Regàs (perennial) and Fuirosos (intermittent)	1	1	Vegetation species described	Soil described	N	N	N	N	N	75	393	1	2	2
394	\N	N/A	N/A	2.1 STORMFLOW ZONE Detailed water budgets indicate that -90% of active subsurface flow occurs through the 1- to 2-m-deep stormflow zone. Natural areas of the ORR are heavily vegetated, and the stormflow zone approximately corresponds to the root zone. Infiltration tests indicate that this zone is as much as 1000 times more permeable than the underlying vadose zone. During rain events, the stormflow zone partially or completely saturates then transmits water laterally to the surface-water system. When the stormflow zone becomes completely saturated, overland flow occurs. Where such excavations as waste trenches penetrate the stormflow zone, a commonly observed condition known as bathtubbing can occur in which the excavation fills with water. Between rain events, as the stormflow zone drains, flow rates decrease dramatically and flow becomes nearly vertical toward the underlying vadose zone. The transmissive capability of the stormflow zone is created primarily by root channels, worm holes, clay aggregation, fractures, etc., collectively referred to as large pores. Although highly transmissive, large pores comprise only --0.2%of the total void volume of the stormflow zone. Because most of the water mass resides within less transmissive small pores, advective-diffusive exchange between large and small pores substantially reduces contaminant migration rates relative to fluid velocities in large pores. \n2.2 VADOSE ZONE A vadose zone exists throughout the ORR except where the water table is at land surface, such as along perennial stream channels. The thickness of the vadose zone is greatest beneath ridges, and thins towards valley floors. Beneath ridges underlain by the Knox aquifer(Copper Ridge, Chestnut Ridge, McKinney Ridge, and Black Ridge), the vadose zone commonly is as much as 50 m thick, whereas beneath ridges underlain by the Rome Formation(Haw Ridge and Pine Ridge) the vadose zone is typically <20 m thick. In lowland areas near streams, a permanent vadose zone does not exist because the stormflow zone intersects the water table. The vadose zone consists of regolith composed mostly of clay and silt, most of which is derived from the weathering of bedrock materials, and which has significant water storage capacity. Most recharge through the vadose zone is episodic and occurs 'along discrete permeable features that may become saturated during rain events, even though surrounding micropores remain unsaturated and contain trapped air. During recharge events, flow paths in the vadose zone are complex, controlled by the orientation of structures of the materials, such as relict fractures. Between recharge events, flow rates decrease dramatically, and flow paths are toward the groundwater zone. \n2.3 GROUNDWATER ZONE A convergence of evidence indicates that most water in the groundwater zone of the aquitards is transmitted through a layer, -1-5 m thick, of closely spaced, connected fractures near the water table, zt, shown below. Many open fractures, which extend only a short distance into the rock, can be seen on outcrops, and the near correspondence of the water table with the top of weathered bedrock in the ORR is probably not coincidental. Regolith above this level has been formed by a large water flux, and the presence of unweathered bedrock at deeper levels apparently indicates a smaller water flux. Cyclic variations in water table elevation change the saturated thickness of the permeable layer. The resulting changes in transmissivity explain ... an order-of-magnitude fluctuation in groundwater discharge rates even though (1) contours of annual high and low water table elevations show little change in hydraulic gradient and ' (2) seasonal changes of water level in most wells are small compared with height of the water level above stream level. Opposite changes in hydraulic gradient and saturated thickness occur from one topographic location to another. The product of transmissivity and hydraulic gradient is constant (or increases with recharge) along each flow path. The range of seasonal fluctuations in depth to the water table and in rates of groundwater flow vary significantly across the reservation. In the areas of the Knox aquifer, seasonal fluctuations in water levels average 5 m and the specific discharge through the active groundwater zone is typically 9 m/year. In the aquitards of Bear Creek Valley, Melton Valley, East Fork Valley, and Bethel Valley, seasonal fluctuations in water levels average 1.5 m, and typical specific discharge is 5 m/year. .m As in the stormflow zone, the bulk of water mass in the water table interval resides within porous matrix blocks between fractures, and diffusive exchange between matrix and fractures reduces contaminant migration rates relative to fracture fluid velocities. For example, the leading edge of a geochemically nonreactive contaminant plume migrates along fractures at a typical rate of 1 m/d; however, the center of mass of a contaminant plume typically migrates at only 0.05 m/d. Below the water table interval, fracture control becomes dominant in flow path direction. The base of the water table interval corresponds to the zone of transition from regolith to bedrock. In the intermediate interval of the groundwater zone, groundwater movement occurs primarily in permeable fractures that are poorly connected in three dimensions. In the Knox aquifer a few hydrologically dominant cavity systems control groundwater movement in this zone, but in the aquitards the bulk of flow is through fractures, along which permeability may be increased by weathering. One fracture set is parallel to and along bedding planes and thus parallel to strike. The dip of this fracture set varies with bedding plane dip, generally ranging between 10 and 50°. A second set is also parallel to strike but perpendicular to bedding planes. The dip of this set also varies with bedding plane dip and thus is a function of depth, inclined near the surface where bedding planes dip more steeply, then vertical at depth where bedding plane dip flattens. A third set is perpendicular to strike. Fracture orientations and converging groundwater flow paths in and near valley floors give rise to preferential groundwater movement along strike, toward cross-cutting tributary drainage ways. Bedding-plane and strike-parallel fractures and their intersections are more permeable than the dip-parallel fractures, and flow paths are along-valley toward crosscutting tributary streams. The chemical characteristics of groundwater change from a mixed-cation-HCO3 water type to an Na-HCO3 type in the ORR aquitards at depths ranging from 30 to 50 m. Although the geochemical mechanism responsible for this change in water types is not entirely quantified, it probably is related to water residence time. The transition from Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3 serves as a useful marker and is used in this report to distinguish the intermediate groundwater interval from the deep interval, a transition which is not marked by a distinct change in rock properties. Below the intermediate interval, small quantities of water are transmitted through discrete fractures in the deep interval. The hydrologically active fractures in tile deep interval are significantly fewer in number and shorter in length than in the other intervals, and the spacing is greater, partly because of less dissolution of fracture fillings. Fracture orientations are similar to those described earlier for the water table interval. Wells finished in the deep interval of the ORR aquitards typically yield <0.1 L/min and thus have no potential for water supply. The specific storage of the bedrock aquitard is small, as a result some hydraulic heads in the deep interval respond to precipitation events, even though the associated water flux is small. The chemical characteristics of groundwater in the deep interval are different from those of the water table interval and probably reflect longer water residence times. Although diffusive transfer between fractures and matrix blocks is an important process in the deep interval, the total matrix porosity is less than that of the water table interval, the vadose zone, or the stormflow zone, thereby reducing the retarding effect on contaminant migration rates relative to more shallow zones. \n	2	2-1	Overview of the conceptual model	1	1	N	N	Geological types described	N	N	N	N	164	394	1	2	2
