(a) Pre-recharge conditions: water moves slowly through the unsaturated zone, ground-water moves through the bedrock adjacent to and underlying the floodplain aquifer (alluvium), and chemically homogeneous ground water fills the saturated portion of the alluvium. (b) Recharge conditions: precipitation enters the bedrock aquifer(s) rapidly, probably through fractures. The newly recharged water displaces â€˜residentâ€™ ground water in the bedrock into the alluvium, causing a relatively rapid rise in water table because of injection of more sulfate-rich water (vertical bars) from the bedrock into the base of the alluvium. The rise in water table entrains high-nitrate water (slanted bars) in the inundated part of the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone water flow continues downward, but is still slow, because low hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium prevents rapid recharge. Unsaturated zone air is pushed upward out of the ground, also, as the alluvium water table rises. (c) Early post-recharge: when recharge to the bedrock ceases, the water table begins to fall as the water in the alluvium drains to the creek. The drop in the water table draws â€˜freshâ€™ atmosphere into the unsaturated zone. The water in the alluvial aquifer begins to mix. (d) Later post-recharge: as the water table continues to fall, mixing continues, and the water also now comes into equilibrium with the fresh unsaturated zone air, resulting in a pulse of oxygen in the alluvial aquifer. The oxygen levels in the alluvial-aquifer ground water decline because of microbial processes, and mixing of the alluvium ground water continues until a nearly chemically homogeneous floodplain aquifer is reestablished (a).",https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0022169403003883-gr9.jpg,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Konza Prairie LTER, Kansas, United States",39.103509,-96.603547,34.87,1,N,4,Event,Vegetation described,Soil types described,Geology described,Slopes described,N,N,N,5,"Groundwater storage, Bedrock fracture storage, Water Table, Water table fall, Water table rise","Sub.GW.Store, Sub.GW.Store.Matrix, Sub.GW.Store.Wtable, Sub.GW.Store.Fall, Sub.GW.Store.Rise",5,"Gaining stream, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Mixing, Vapor diffusion, Groundwater flow","Sub.GWSW.Gain, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.Soil.Mix, Sub.Soil.Vapor, Sub.GW.Flow",1,N/A

(a) Digital elevation overview of Potrero Grande watershed (Landsat Image, USGS, 90 m). Yellow line represents watershed boundary and yellow dashed-square denotes Quebrada Danta subcatchment. Red cross corresponds to the hyperalkaline system. (b) Enlargement of yellow dashed-square area over Quebrada Danta subcatchment; mean basin slope is âˆ¼33%. Vegetation is scarce on hillslopes; but mostly concentrated in the riparian zones of the floodplain. (c) A conceptual hyperalkaline base flow process coupled with measured water chemistry and field observations. Soil profile is relatively absent (less than 20 cm). Infiltration occurs directly through the ultramafic formation (1). Piston-type flow may occur within serpertinized fractured macropores (i.e., faults) producing freshwater springs if the system is open in respect to CO2 (2). These flow paths appear to be relatively shallow. Deep groundwater flow feeds the creek during the dry season (4). Base flow discharge is a function of storage, where a corresponds to the characteristic recession time scale (presumably low due to high evapotranspiration). Hydraulic parameters such as conductivity (K), drainage porosity (f), and aquifer thickness (D) are unknown. If the system responds as a linear reservoir, then bâ€‰=â€‰1. Deep groundwater flow may dilute the signature of active serpentinizing (3). However, active serpentinizing flow paths could also emerge as hyperalkaline springs probably with an exponential-piston flow distribution due to the constant structural changes (6). Hyperalkaline fluids form riparian pools coated by a CaCO3 supernatant film where travertine terraces are evident and potential heterotrophic microbial methanogenesis may also occur (7 and 8). The hyperalkaline fluids are characterized by high pH, Ca, and low Mg. The fluids mix with receiving stream waters at low rates and volumes, thus, dilution occurs rapidly (9). As measured in the RÃ­o MurciÃ©lago watershed methane emanations (24.3% v/v) occur at the streambed (5). Other hydrocarbons may be produced during the serpentinization process. Based on the Mulligan and Burke [2005] regional hydrological model (90 m resolution), recharge could be approximately 18% of the water budget whereas runoff could reach up to 21% during the wet season and evapotranspiration is roughly 60%. Shallow storage could be as lower as 3%.",https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f99812b1-af08-4159-b6e5-9de9bee7379e/ggge20449-fig-0008-m.jpg,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Santa Elena Ophiolite, Costa Rica",10.853098,-85.788389,250,1,N,1,N,Vegetation described,N,N,Slopes described,N,N,N,3,"Depression storage, Groundwater storage, Channel storage","Surf.Water.Depr, Sub.GW.Store, Chan.Store",8,"Springflow, Vertical drainage to groundwater, Gaining stream, Evapotranspiration, Infiltration, Overland Flow, Pistonflow, Groundwater flow","Sub.GW.Ret.Spr, Sub.Soil.Drain, Sub.GWSW.Gain, Surf.ET, Surf.Inf.Inf, Surf.Over, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston, Sub.GW.Flow",1,N/A

For illustrative purposes, the thickness of the upper soil horizons is not to scale and remains constant along slopes. We refer the reader to Tables 1 and 2 for the exact thickness of the soil horizons. Variations in soil thickness and physicochemical properties have been reported from soil mapping (Erauw, 2019). Due to the complex heterogeneity in the distribution of soil horizons, ash layers, volcanoclastic materials, and lava flows at the transition between toeslope and wetland positions, these soils are not shown in the conceptual diagram (marked with a question mark) since they do not affect the interpretation of the main findings.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd62298a-e1f4-4580-8746-0f2105fd3f73/hyp14725-fig-0008-m.jpg,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Jatunhuaycu Experimental Observatory, Ecuador",-0.4884968,-78.2398049,32.6,2,Land use / Land cover,1,N,Vegetation types described,Horizons described,N,Slopes described,N,Unknown items identified,N,2,"Soil saturation, Soil water storage","Sub.Soil.Store.Satur, Sub.Soil.Store",6,"Lateral matrix flow at soil horizons, Overland Flow, Vertical matrix flow, Subsurface stormflow, Channel flow, Pistonflow","Sub.SSFlow.Matrix.Horiz, Surf.Over, Sub.Soil.Matrix, Sub.SSFlow, Chan.Flow, Sub.GW.Disp.Piston",1,N/A
